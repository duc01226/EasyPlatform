# Documentation Standards

**Master index:** Read [`docs/BUSINESS-FEATURES.md`](../../docs/BUSINESS-FEATURES.md)
**Business feature template:** Read [`docs/templates/detailed-feature-docs-template.md`](../../docs/templates/detailed-feature-docs-template.md)

## Rules

1. **Business feature docs** go in `docs/business-features/` — use the 26-section template
2. **Technical docs** go in `docs/claude/` — pattern guides, architecture, troubleshooting
3. **Plans and reports** go in `plans/` and `plans/reports/`
4. **Cross-references:** Use relative Markdown links, not absolute paths
5. **Table of contents:** Include for docs over 100 lines
6. **Code examples:** Include file paths and line numbers when referencing code
7. **Last updated:** Include date at the bottom of docs that change frequently
