**Ultrathink** to plan and implement these tasks with maximum verification:
<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**Mode:** HARD - Extra research, detailed planning, mandatory reviews.

## Workflow

### 1. Deep Research Phase
- Launch 2-3 `researcher` subagents in parallel covering:
  - Technical approach validation
  - Edge cases and failure modes
  - Security implications
  - Performance considerations
- Use `/scout:ext` for comprehensive codebase analysis
- Generate research reports (max 150 lines each)

### 2. Comprehensive Planning
- Use `planner` subagent with all research reports
- Create full plan directory with:
  - `plan.md` - Overview with risk assessment
  - `phase-XX-*.md` - Detailed phase files
  - Success criteria for each phase
  - Rollback strategy

### 3. Verified Implementation
- Implement one phase at a time
- After each phase:
  - Run type-check and compile
  - Run relevant tests
  - Self-review before proceeding

### 4. Mandatory Testing
- Use `tester` subagent for full test coverage
- Write tests for:
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Edge cases from research
  - Error handling paths
- NO mocks or fake data allowed
- Repeat until all tests pass

### 5. Mandatory Code Review
- Use `code-reviewer` subagent
- Address all critical and major findings
- Re-run tests after fixes
- Repeat until approved

### 6. Documentation Update
- Use `docs-manager` to update relevant docs
- Use `project-manager` to update project status
- Record any architectural decisions

### 7. Final Report
- Summary of all changes
- Test coverage metrics
- Security considerations addressed
- Unresolved questions (if any)
- Ask user to review and approve

## When to Use

- Critical production features
- Security-sensitive changes
- Public API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Cross-service integrations
