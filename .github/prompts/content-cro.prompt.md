# CRO Content Optimization

Optimize UI copy and calls-to-action for better conversion rates.

## When to Use

- Improving sign-up/onboarding flows
- Optimizing landing pages
- Enhancing form completion rates
- Reducing bounce rates
- Improving button click-through

## CRO Principles

### 1. Value Proposition

Make benefits clear immediately:

```
// Weak
"Sign up for our newsletter"

// Strong
"Get weekly tips to boost your productivity"
```

### 2. Reduce Friction

Minimize perceived effort:

```
// High friction
"Complete the registration form"

// Low friction
"Create your free account in 30 seconds"
```

### 3. Create Urgency

Without being pushy:

```
// Aggressive
"BUY NOW!!!"

// Effective
"Start your 14-day trial - no credit card required"
```

### 4. Social Proof

Build trust:

```
"Join 10,000+ developers using EasyPlatform"
"Rated 4.8/5 by 500+ teams"
```

## CTA Optimization

### Button Text

| Weak | Strong | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Submit | Create Account | Specific action |
| Click Here | Download Report | Clear benefit |
| Learn More | See How It Works | Sets expectation |
| Buy | Start Free Trial | Lower commitment |

### Placement

- Above the fold for primary CTAs
- After value explanation for secondary
- Repeat for long pages

### Visual Hierarchy

- Primary: High contrast, larger
- Secondary: Outlined or subtle
- One clear primary per screen

## Form Optimization

### Labels

```
// Generic
"Name"

// Helpful
"Your name (as it appears on your ID)"
```

### Placeholders

```
// Redundant
placeholder="Enter your email"

// Helpful
placeholder="name@company.com"
```

### Error States

```
// Blocking
"Invalid"

// Guiding
"Please enter a valid email (e.g., name@company.com)"
```
