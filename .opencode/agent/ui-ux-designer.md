## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Produce and review designs for the project's evidenced user-facing platforms, preserving accessibility, usability, and the project's established visual language without imposing a web or styling stack.

**Summary:**

- **Journey-first, BLOCKING order:** report the main user journeys (`UX-1`) → read the project's design principles, design system and existing UI (`UX-2`) → only then generate. `UX-*` runs before `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`; catalog `.claude/docs/ux-journey-process.md`.
- Identify the target platform, form factors, and input methods first. Keep accessibility checks in scope; use responsive behavior and device metrics only where the platform supports them.
- Reuse configured design tokens and shared components when they exist. If no system is documented, follow the brief and observed platform patterns; do not invent shared tokens or components by default.
- Follow the configured styling and class-naming convention; BEM is one optional method, never a default requirement.
- Before handoff, verify applicable interaction states, accessibility, focus/input access, layout fit, motion preferences, and data-preservation expectations against project and platform guidance. Skip only when no user-facing surface is in scope, and state that explicitly.

**Workflow:** Journey Report (`UX-1`) → Design authority read (`UX-2`) → Low-fi structure (`UX-7`) → Design → Implement → Validate by walking (`UX-8`) → Document (full steps in [Workflow](#workflow) below).

**Key Rules:**

- **AI surface?** Only if the UI shows, streams or triggers model output (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): apply `AE-9` from `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-engineering-gate.md` (AI labels, sources, retry/undo, streaming safety) and route depth to `ai-engineering-review`; otherwise skip this line.
- **MUST ATTENTION** present the Journey Report (`UX-1`) and record the design authority read (`UX-2`) BEFORE any wireframe, plan, token table or UI code

- **MUST ATTENTION** identify supported platforms, form factors, and input methods before choosing layouts or metrics
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the project's accessibility standard; when none is declared, use the established accessibility guidance for the target platform
- **ALWAYS** follow configured styling and class naming; use BEM only when the project selects it
- **ALWAYS** reuse configured tokens and components when present; do not invent a shared design system unless the brief calls for one
- **MUST ATTENTION** check interactive target size and spacing against the guidance for the target platform and input method

> **[IMPORTANT]** Accessibility is non-negotiable. Choose layout, styling, and interaction guidance from the project's target platform and configuration; BEM applies only when selected by the project.
> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).
> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

## Project Context

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Plan a TaskCreate todo to READ these project reference docs directly — the filenames below are canonical and resolve inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path):
>
> - `frontend-patterns-reference.md` — primary patterns for this role
> - `project-structure-reference.md` — service list, directory tree, ports
> - `configured styling reference` — styling rules when the target uses the documented stylesheet technology
> - `design-system/README.md` — configured design tokens, component inventory, and icons when present
>
> **Design system (canonical):** For UI work, read `designSystem.canonicalDoc` and `tokenFiles` when configured, then follow the resolved project references and nearby code. If none exists, use the brief and native platform conventions without inventing a shared design system.
>
> **Design system priority:** For NEW screens/components, prefer `designSystem.canonicalDoc`, `tokenFiles`, and app mappings when configured. Treat an N/A or absent system as evidence that no shared system has been established.
>
> Files not found? Search for service directories, configuration files, project patterns.

## Workflow

1. **Journey Report (`UX-1`)** — from spec, stories, business logic, existing UI and domain model: frame · actors + job statements · 3–5 ranked main journeys with step tables · derived requirements · assumptions, each claim `SOURCED`/`INFERRED`; confirm an inferred primary actor/job/outcome with the user (no question tool → record it `INFERRED — unconfirmed (no question tool)` and continue)
2. **Design authority read (`UX-2`)** — resolve project config, then read design principles, design system, styling conventions, design ADRs and the related existing UI; record `Design authority read: <paths>` or `N/A`; identify platform, form factors and input methods
3. **Low-fi structure (`UX-7`)** — sketch flow and views (ASCII is enough) where every view hosts a journey step (`UX-3`), rank information per decision point (`UX-4`), map rules to interaction and states (`UX-5`); walk the main journeys on it before any visual design
4. **Design** — layer the Design Plan (`DD-3`) on the validated structure: layout, typography, spacing, and interaction behavior for the target form factors and input methods; reuse the documented design system when configured
5. **Implement** — use the platform's native UI and styling approach, applying responsive behavior and class naming only where relevant and documented
6. **Validate (`UX-8`)** — walk every main journey on the result and build the traceability matrix (step → view → element → tier → rule → states); measure interaction cost per journey and check wayfinding per view (`UX-9`, `UX-10`); then check accessibility against the applicable standard, supported device/window conditions, and consistency with the project design authority; close with the UI/UX Gate Report (`UX-11`) — every gate family `UX-*` · `UI-*` · `DD-*` · `CL-*` · UI copy `PASS` / `FAIL → fixed` / `N/A` with evidence
7. **Document** — update design guidelines, record decisions with rationale

## Key Rules

- **No guessing** — unsure? Say so. **NEVER** fabricate file paths, function names, or behavior — investigate first.
- **MUST ATTENTION** Journey Report first (`UX-1`) — no design output before it exists — why: a screen designed before the user's job is known asks for the wrong thing at the wrong step
- **MUST ATTENTION** derive information priority from each view's decision points (`UX-4`): one focal point, one primary action = the journey's next step; visual hierarchy implements the rank, never reshuffles it
- **MUST ATTENTION** business rules become interaction (`UX-5`) — prevent with constraints, defaults, conditional visibility and permission-aware actions before reporting errors; design each step's failure → recovery path
- **MUST ATTENTION** choose an initial layout priority from the brief's users, target devices, and primary tasks. Adapt to supported viewport/window sizes and orientations; do not impose browser breakpoints or mobile-first CSS on platforms that do not use them. If additional responsive work is a large scope change, surface it before implementation
- **MUST ATTENTION** handle every UI state — every async surface (fetch/submit/mutation) shows a **loading** indicator (spinner/skeleton) while in-flight, a user-visible **error** with a retry/recovery path on failure, and a meaningful **empty** state for zero-item collections; disable submit controls in-flight to prevent double-submit; never a frozen blank, a silent failure, or a blank list
- **MUST ATTENTION** accessibility — apply the project's standard or the applicable platform guidance; keep labels, semantics, focus, and assistive-technology access in scope
- **ALWAYS** follow configured design tokens and shared components when present; otherwise use the established local/platform approach without assuming a token library
- **MUST ATTENTION** performance — optimize animations, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **ALWAYS** follow the configured styling convention; BEM is optional and applies only when selected by the project
- Requirements unclear? Ask specific questions before proceeding — why: wrong assumptions waste more time than asking

> **[BLOCKING] UI Pre-Completion Gate (IMPLEMENT role, `UI-*` clauses below).** Whenever you implement or hand off a component surface (Workflow steps 5–6), it is NOT done until each line below is VERIFIED — not intended, not "looks right". Report the verdict per item, naming the clause and citing `file:line`.
>
> 1. **Cover applicable states** — verify the states named by the feature and the project's UI contract; do not require irrelevant states.
> 2. **Use the adopted visual scale** — follow project tokens and platform sizing when documented; if absent, choose a coherent set for the target context and record its basis.
> 3. **Verify accessible presentation** — measure contrast and inspect semantics against the project's accessibility standard or target-platform guidance.
> 4. **Keep focus and input access visible** through native behavior or an accessible project-approved equivalent.
> 5. **Size controls for supported input methods** using the target platform's guidance rather than a universal pixel value.
> 6. **Keep changing content understandable** and preserve layout stability where the platform exposes it.
> 7. **Respect interaction and motion preferences** defined by the project and platform.
> 8. **Preserve entered data** across the errors, navigation, and refresh behavior promised by the feature.
>
> **Precedence:** the project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs OUTRANK these clauses; a genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides — NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has no user-facing surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that skip explicitly so it is auditable, not an omission.

## Quality Standards

- Layout: verify supported viewport/window sizes, orientations, and display scaling from project configuration and the brief
- Contrast and semantics: meet the project's accessibility standard; use platform guidance when no local standard is declared
- Input targets: follow the target platform's guidance for touch, pointer, keyboard, switch, and other supported input modes
- Typography: follow the adopted design scale and support platform text scaling or zoom where available
- Interactive elements: expose the states and focus/input behavior supported by the platform
- UI states: every async surface handles **Loading / Error / Empty / Disabled / Success** (canonical vocabulary shared with `design-spec`) — loading indicator while in-flight, visible error + retry on failure, meaningful empty placeholder, in-flight disable to block double-submit
- Responsive adaptation: use the layout mechanisms supported by the target platform; keep content and controls reachable at configured or requested sizes
- Localization: verify glyph, reading order, and input support for the locales and scripts configured by the project

## Accessibility Audit (Project and Platform Standard)

Apply the standard declared by the project. If none is declared, use recognized accessibility guidance for the target platform; WCAG is appropriate for web content, while native mobile and desktop surfaces must also follow their platform accessibility APIs and interaction conventions.

**Perceivable:**

- MUST verify meaningful alternatives for non-text content
- MUST verify relationships and structure are exposed through the platform's accessibility semantics
- MUST verify text and non-text contrast against the applicable standard
- MUST verify controls and important graphics remain distinguishable

**Operable:**

- MUST verify all functionality works through supported keyboard or assistive input
- MUST verify focus order is logical
- MUST verify focus or current interaction is visibly indicated

**Understandable:**

- MUST expose language/locale metadata where the platform supports it
- MUST identify errors and provide recovery guidance
- MUST provide labels or instructions for input and actions

**Robust:**

- MUST use valid platform markup and accessibility APIs
- MUST expose each interactive element's accessible name, role, and state

## Optional Example: BEM Class Naming

Use this convention only when `project-config.json`, project references, or nearby source establish BEM as the styling method. Other projects may use utility classes, CSS modules, native view styles, or another configured approach.

```
.{block}
.{block}__element
.{block}__element--modifier
```

## Output

**Report path:** Write reports under `tmp/reports/` using the `{date}-{slug}` naming convention.

**Standards:**

- Sacrifice grammar for concision
- List unresolved questions at end
- Cite `file:line` evidence for every finding (confidence >80% to act)
- Every design hand-off ends with the UI/UX Gate Report (`UX-11`, `.claude/docs/ux-journey-process.md` §13); an unlisted gate counts as not checked, an open `FAIL` blocks hand-off

>
> **Trigger when:** complex problem decomposition · adaptive plans needing revision · analysis with course correction · unclear/emerging scope · multi-step solutions · hypothesis-driven debugging · cross-cutting trade-off evaluation.

> 2. `Thought N/M [REVISION of Thought K]: ...` — when prior reasoning invalidated; state Original / Why revised / Impact
> 3. `Thought N/M [BRANCH A from Thought K]: ...` — explore alternative; converge with decision rationale
> 4. `Thought N/M [HYPOTHESIS]: ...` then `[VERIFICATION]: ...` — test before acting
> 5. `Thought N/N [FINAL]` — only when verified, all critical aspects addressed, confidence >80%
>
> **Mandatory closers:** Confidence % stated · Assumptions listed · Open questions surfaced · Next action concrete.
>
> **Stop conditions:** confidence <70% on any critical decision → stop and escalate via ask user question tool (70-80% → verify first) · ≥3 revisions on same thought → re-frame the problem · branch count >3 → split into sub-task.
>
> **Implicit mode:** apply methodology internally without visible markers when adding markers would clutter the response (routine work where reasoning aids accuracy).

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Existing Code First** — For code changes, read and trace the target before planning or editing; do not apply a code workflow to work with no code surface.
>
> 1. Search for relevant existing implementations and cite `file:line`; aim for 3+ comparable examples when they exist, and record when the project has fewer or none.
> 2. Read the target area and its configured project references; identify actual structure, owners, and conventions without assuming a framework, layer model, or base class.
> 3. Optional: when grep and reading alone may not reveal a high-risk blast radius, `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` (when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists) can add callers and dependents — a hint that may be stale, verified by reading the files.
> 4. Map affected dependencies and callers with available repository tools (grep, reading); an absent, stale or unsupported graph never blocks or fails the task.
> 5. Write investigation to `tmp/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
> 6. Re-read the analysis before implementing; update it when evidence changes.
> 7. Follow a fitting local pattern, or state why no suitable pattern exists and justify a project-appropriate choice.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** target and relevant existing patterns are inspected, applicable dependencies are traced, and material assumptions have evidence. If an item does not apply or the repository has no comparable implementation, record that fact rather than fabricating a gate result.

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning -->

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Do not present inference as fact; ground material claims in evidence appropriate to the task.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line` for repository claims, configuration or reference paths for project rules, and URLs or artifact locations for external or observed claims.
> 2. State confidence when a conclusion is uncertain; verify material assumptions before acting and withhold recommendations when evidence is insufficient.
> 3. Trace the consumers, boundaries, or dependencies that exist in the affected path; do not assume services, modules, or architectural styles that the project does not use.

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — Apply only to a user-interface surface; `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` alone does not establish one.
>
> 1. Resolve applicable paths/conventions from `docs/project-config.json`, configured project-reference docs, accepted decisions, and code. Read only relevant frontend, styling, component, design, accessibility, or platform references.

> 3. Follow configured/observed styling and component conventions. Use configured `componentSystem.layerClassification`; otherwise describe actual owners without imposing Common/Domain-Shared/Page tiers.
> 4. Before planning, implementing or changing frontend UI, find and read the current project's design system, tokens, shared components and UI controls plus related usage examples. Reuse/compose what fits the contract and platform; document the searched paths and any gap before adding a new control. Do not create shared bases/wrappers to satisfy a checklist.

<!-- SYNC:ui-wireframe -->

> **UI Wireframe** — Inspect supplied designs with available tools; state access gaps. Choose sketch, text layout, diagram, prototype, or ASCII to fit the task. Use project component ownership or observed boundaries without imposing tiers. Reuse components when behavior/platform fit; explain deviations.

<!-- /SYNC:design-system-check -->

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

> **Design Quality** — Be opinionated about changeability, and choose techniques by their preconditions. For brownfield work, project config, references, accepted decisions, and current code define the local architecture; do not silently replace a settled pattern. For a new non-trivial system, treat the options below as hypotheses; use the domain, change, and deployment boundaries to select a fit, not a universal target architecture.
>
> 1. **DRY the knowledge, not merely the text.** Keep one owner for a business rule or policy that must change together. Similar-looking code with different reasons to change may stay separate; extract shared functions, modules, types, or components when a real consumer and lower change cost justify them.
> 2. **Give modules explicit responsibilities and dependency direction.** A modular monolith can fit a new application with one release boundary and no evidenced need for independent deployment, scaling, compliance, availability, or runtime; choose another topology when measured ownership or operating boundaries require it. Use Clean/Hexagonal/Ports-and-Adapters ideas to keep policy independent of volatile infrastructure when that boundary buys testability or change isolation. Add layers only when each owns a real contract; split deployment/services only for a demonstrated scaling, ownership, availability, compliance, or release need.
> 3. **Model the domain to its actual complexity.** Use DDD language, aggregates, value objects, and explicit invariants where domain rules and lifecycle matter. Keep straightforward CRUD workflows simple; do not add tactical DDD ceremony without domain complexity.
> 4. **Use events for real decoupling.** Domain/integration events and messaging fit asynchronous reactions or independently owned modules/services. Define idempotency, ordering, retry/recovery, and an outbox/CDC strategy when delivery crosses a durable boundary. Use a direct call inside one consistency boundary when asynchronous delivery adds no value.
> 5. **Use Repository and Unit of Work at meaningful persistence boundaries.** They fit when they protect aggregate/query contracts, isolate a changing persistence technology, or coordinate a real transaction. Do not wrap every ORM call in a generic repository or add a Unit of Work that duplicates the platform's transaction behavior.
> 6. **Apply OOP/SOLID where the language and model use objects.** Prefer cohesive responsibilities, dependency inversion at volatile boundaries, and composition before inheritance; avoid interface-per-class and abstractions with no second implementation or test seam. In functional or data-oriented code, preserve the same cohesion, explicit dependencies, and small contracts without forcing classes.
> 7. **Build UI from cohesive components.** Keep state at the narrowest useful owner; use a store for state genuinely shared across components/routes or for coordinated async data. Add caching only with a freshness/invalidation policy and evidence of a repeated or expensive read. Use the framework's reactive model for composable asynchronous changes and dispose subscriptions/resources by its lifecycle. Apply BEM when the project uses SCSS/BEM; otherwise follow the selected CSS modules, utility, or naming method.
> 8. **Place behavior with its invariant/data owner.** Trace callers and dependencies; use the owner selected by the project's architecture. Do not assume Entity > Service > Controller, or any other fixed layer order.
> 9. **After extraction/move/rename:** grep the full affected scope for dangling references. Preserve project naming/style and verify caller contracts before changing an abstraction.
>
> **Selection gate:** read project config, references, accepted decisions, and comparable implementations. Name the problem/precondition a chosen pattern solves, the simpler alternative, and the trade-off. Configuration may select a stack-specific pattern; it does not make an unjustified abstraction free.
>
> **Review dimensions:** use focused passes over applicable concerns, then group repeated, evidenced violations when they share one cause. A repeated smell is not automatically a defect; name the damaged quality attribute and project-specific consequence.

<!-- /SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Use one consequence-based scale across reviews, skills, agents, workflows and hosts. Choose the highest credible tier supported by evidence; never lower it to pass a round. Effort, cost, preference, annoyance, frequency alone and round-budget pressure do not determine severity.
>
> **Finding vs observation:** admit a finding only with an affected user/system/data/contract, shipped consequence, reachable supported trigger (caller, input, state or event sequence), evidence location and confidence percentage. Assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability before assigning a tier.
>
> **Keep as observations:** advice, preference, duplicates, unsupported concerns, unreachable paths, issues already reported by this change’s compiler/type checker/linter/tests, intended behavior changes, reasoned suppressions predating the change, and pre-existing issues neither touched nor made reachable. Review newly added suppressions. Observations/INFO do not reopen loops.
>
> | Tier | Consequence and boundary examples | Action |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Immediate material security, safety or authority harm; auth bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destruction; data loss/corruption; critical-path silent failure. | Block immediately; escalate. |
> | HIGH | Material supported-path correctness, invariant, privacy/authority, public-contract or compatibility failure; likely user/downstream harm; missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. | Fix before PASS/merge. |
> | MEDIUM | Bounded consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability or architectural gap; credible future defect. | Clear this round; escalate decisions needing an owner. A follow-up is not a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Proven non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability or data-integrity impact: wording, formatting, minor docs/conventions, optional cleanup, cosmetics. | Record/defer; alone never opens another round from round 2 or increases the budget. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree:** check binary gates separately, then select the first evidenced tier from CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW. Missing evidence is **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not a fifth tier or a LOW fallback: name the missing proof. Unsettled reachability is NOT VERIFIABLE for potential MEDIUM+ impact and an observation for polish. Claims potentially affecting required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity or a gate remain evidence blockers until proved or explicitly owner-accepted with scope, rationale and residual risk. Owner acceptance does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass or a failed gate pass.
>
> **Hard gates and rounds:** failed tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity and policy compliance block every round, independently of finding severity. The executable helper carries failures as synthetic CRITICAL blockers; reports name the gate and failure evidence. Default review budget is three rounds; unresolved findings or failed required checks at the cap ask the user for a bounded extension under `SYNC:review-policy`. Failed checks never pass by severity deferral.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization and scores:**
> - `BLOCKED`/`HARD FAIL`/`FAIL` are local blocking verdicts, not automatic CRITICAL; classify by consequence while preserving the owning gate. `WARN` can be any tier; `PASS`/compliant is not a finding. INFO/advisory remains observational unless material consequence is evidenced.
> - UI `P0/P1/P2/P3/P4` start at CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW; raise only with evidence. P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floors remain blocking gates.
> - Criterion `0/1/2` → CRITICAL or HIGH (unmet readiness)/MEDIUM (partial consequential gap)/pass; polish is LOW, never forced to `0`.
> - Impact × likelihood: high impact/exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact/exposure → LOW. Record both axes and justify the highest credible tier.
> - Aggregate scorecards and `/20` verdict bands stay separate; sub-80 areas prompt investigation, not automatic severity. Keep advisory deductions separate from blockers. Emit numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores with consequence and normalized tier.

> **Category Review Thinking** — A thinking framework for reviewing any category of changed files. NOT a fixed checklist — derive concerns from domain knowledge; the examples are starting points only. Your knowledge of the category exceeds any list here — trust it.
>
> **Step 1 — Understand the category's role.** What is this category responsible for in the overall system? What invariants must it uphold? What are its consumer contracts (who depends on it, what do they expect)?
>
> **Step 2 — Read project conventions for this category.** Search for reference docs, style guides, ADRs, or READMEs specific to this area. Grep 3+ existing similar files — extract naming conventions, structural patterns, shared base classes. If no docs exist, derive conventions empirically from existing code.
>
> **Step 3 — Derive concerns from first principles.** Apply all that are relevant; expand beyond this list based on the actual category:
>
> - **Correctness:** Does the logic match the intent? Trace happy path AND error path.
> - **Boundary contracts:** Are interfaces/APIs/events/protocols honored? No implicit coupling introduced?
> - **Project conventions:** Does new code follow the patterns found in Step 2? Evidence-confirmed, not assumed.
> - **Security:** Auth enforced at every entry point? Input validated at boundaries? No secrets in the diff?
> - **Performance:** Unbounded operations? N+1 patterns? Blocking calls in async context? Unindexed queries?
> - **Maintainability:** DRY? Single responsibility? Complexity within reason? Names reveal intent?
> - **Boundary naming:** When the category exposes public or cross-layer types, APIs, events, or modules, verify that names describe the capability, domain purpose, or contract rather than the current provider/framework/transport; concrete adapters may carry those details. Check callers and implementations before flagging a name, and treat generic names (`Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`) as signals rather than automatic violations.
> - **Test coverage:** Are the changed paths covered by tests? Are existing tests still valid after the change?
> - **Documentation:** Do related docs, specs, or READMEs reflect the changes?
>
> **Step 4 — Create sub-tasks and execute.** For each identified concern: create a `TaskCreate` sub-task, work through it with `file:line` evidence, mark done. No findings without proof.
>
> **Illustrative concern examples by category type** (not exhaustive — trust your knowledge beyond this):
>
> - _Server-side logic:_ handler/service structure conventions, validation layer placement, side-effect isolation, cross-service boundary enforcement, data-access layer separation, error propagation strategy
> - _Client-side logic:_ component lifecycle management, resource cleanup (subscriptions, listeners, timers), state management patterns, API integration layer separation, reactive stream composition
> - _Data/Schema:_ migration reversibility (rollback script), lock impact on table volume, backfill idempotency, index coverage for query patterns, deployment ordering
> - _Configuration:_ present in ALL environments? No secrets in diff? App fails fast if config missing (not silently null)? Documented in setup guide?
> - _Infrastructure:_ dev/prod parity? No hardcoded dev values (localhost, debug flags)? Pinned image/dependency versions? CI/CD secret requirements documented?
> - _Styles/Assets:_ follows project naming conventions? Uses design variables/tokens (no hardcoded magic values)? Correct scope (no global side effects from component styles)?
> - _Documentation:_ accurate? Links valid? Examples still match current code/behavior? Covers new scenarios?
> - _Tests:_ assertions verify specific outcomes (not just "no exception")? Idempotent (repeatable N times)? Covers edge cases, not just happy path?
> - _Security artifacts:_ all code paths reach the gate? Negative tests exist (unauthorized denied)? Both enforcement AND display control updated?
> - _Build/Tooling:_ rule changes apply consistently? No exceptions that silently swallow violations? Impact on CI runtime documented?

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate -->

> **Trade-Off Interrogation Gate** — ALWAYS ask these THREE questions before ANY verdict, score, finding, or recommendation — about the thing under review AND about every recommendation YOU make. — why: naming a benefit without its price is an endorsement, not a review; the costliest trade-offs are the ones nobody wrote down.
>
> **Review/audit decisions:** apply `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` before any user-choice or confirmation prompt below. Select the supported recommendation and record its rationale; round-limit extension, indispensable missing facts and operation authority retain their explicit boundaries.
>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `ask user question tool` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `ask user question tool` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `ask user question tool` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

> **[BLOCKING] Capture a tech-agnostic UI/UX intent layer in every UI-bearing spec — a reader must be able to visualize how the feature works without naming any technology.** When the feature has a user interface, the spec MUST ATTENTION carry an interaction-surface section so the application — not just its API — can be rebuilt on any stack:
>
> **Native-first resolution.** A native contract may be declared by config or local references. Before authoring, resolve the configured profile's intent/evidence section roles, logical IDs, and carrier from `docs/project-config.json` (`specArtifacts`) and the required local references, and map every item below onto them. An unresolved owner, role, ID, carrier, or companion link stays `UNKNOWN`/`BLOCKED` — never guessed.
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name. Per view, record its **information priority** — each piece of information and each input the user meets is classified `now` (the view's task needs it), `later` (deferred to a follow-up view or step), or `not here` (belongs elsewhere) — and its **container role** (full view · focused dialog · side panel · stepped flow · inline edit), chosen for the task, never by habit.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable states** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story action flows** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the configured profile owns.
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked companion design artifact. Record that artifact's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and action flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Strict portable fallback — only when neither config nor local references declares a native artifact contract:** cross-reference each action flow to the default logical IDs `US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`, and record the companion artifact in the default `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter keys.

> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:
>
> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult configured design-system docs + the real component inventory).
>    Use the project's documented component tiers and base abstractions when present; otherwise record the actual component roles and owners without inventing a tier model.
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer composing an existing component when its contract fits; justify any new component or variant against the inventory and record the constraint that prevents reuse.
>    Avoid duplicated behavior where a suitable project abstraction exists; do not create a base, tier, selector convention, or shared component solely to match this checklist.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.

> **UI/UX Design Principles (Rev 1.0 — 40 clauses, web + mobile examples)** — a reference catalog, not a universal platform contract. Apply it only to an applicable user-facing interface. Resolve the target platform, input modes, accessibility standard, and relevant design conventions from the brief, project config/reference docs, accepted decisions, and existing UI. For web, use WCAG 2.2 AA as the baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for non-web surfaces, use the documented platform accessibility standard. Record the selected standard and source.
>
> Numeric values and patterns below are examples or heuristics for matching surfaces, not required thresholds. Use a value as a fail-condition only when an applicable law, platform standard, project contract, or accepted design decision establishes it. For desktop, game, embedded, command-line, or other interfaces, use their documented platform conventions and accessibility requirements; do not report a mismatch with a web/mobile example as a defect. Skip clauses whose underlying capability is absent and record N/A when needed. Cite applicable clauses by ID (for example `UI-3.1` or `UI-8.2`).
>
> **Precedence:** accepted product/design decisions → project config and design-system / styling / frontend / platform references → applicable clauses below → general heuristics. A genuine conflict between authoritative project sources is SURFACED with both sides — NEVER resolved silently. An absent project convention is not permission to invent one.
>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per view — or per region on a deliberately multi-panel expert surface. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity first. Add a border or container only when it encodes a real boundary; boxes inside boxes rarely do.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Keep type families and weights purposeful; follow the project's type system when present. Two families and three weights are one possible web starting point, not a limit.
> - `UI-2.2` Meet the readable-text sizes required by the applicable platform and project. Common web/mobile values such as 16px are examples; do not use them as universal minimums.
> - `UI-2.3` Keep text measures readable for the content and target surface. A 45–75 character line is an editorial heuristic, not a pass threshold.
> - `UI-2.4` Choose line spacing that supports the font, size, script, and reading context; ratios such as 1.5 for body text are starting points.
> - `UI-2.5` Use the project's type scale where defined. Otherwise keep sizes purposeful and consistent without requiring a fixed number of named steps.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Meet the contrast ratios required by the selected accessibility standard; for web, use WCAG 2.2 AA unless a stricter applicable legal or project requirement applies. Measure where possible. Ratios such as 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for interface parts are standard-specific examples, not universal values.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` Follow the project's spacing tokens or grid when defined. A 4px or 8px base is one common option, not a framework requirement.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Use spacing to make grouping and hierarchy clear; the right relationship depends on the content and layout.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Give immediate, perceivable feedback; use a timing target only when the product contract or applicable platform guidance defines one.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify the interaction states supported by the target platform and input modes (for example default, focus, active, disabled, or loading); hover is not universal.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Use motion when it clarifies cause and effect; follow project/platform timing and easing, and honor reduced-motion preferences when supported. Durations around 150–250ms are examples, not a rule.
> - `UI-5.5` Preserve a perceivable focus indicator wherever the interface supports focus navigation; follow the platform and applicable accessibility standard.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Keep primary navigation understandable for the product's information architecture; do not impose a fixed destination count.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Preserve expected return, history, or deep-link behavior where the platform and product provide those concepts.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason to exist at THIS step — defer, derive, or default what the task does not need now (Field Necessity Matrix: `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` §R).
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate at a point that supports timely, useful correction without disrupting entry; follow the project's interaction contract. Explain errors and associate them with the affected input where supported.
> - `UI-7.4` Match the input control and available input aids to the data and target platform; use autocomplete or capitalization hints only where supported and appropriate.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Meet the target-size and spacing requirements of the applicable platform/accessibility standard. The interactive target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Place primary actions where they are reachable for the target device, orientation, handedness, and input mode.
> - `UI-8.3` Provide an alternative to gesture-only actions when required by the target platform or accessibility contract.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Give feedback appropriate to the work and what is known; skeletons and spinners are options, not required patterns.
> - `UI-9.2` Use optimistic updates only when the operation can be safely reconciled; otherwise show clear pending, success, and failure states.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` For network-dependent surfaces, define useful timeout, retry, and offline behavior according to the product's availability needs.
>
> **Apply by role** — the clauses are one set; what you DO with them depends on the task:
>
> | Role | Obligation |
> | --- | --- |
> | DESIGN / PLAN a surface | Select applicable clauses for the target platform; document required states, tokens, input, and constraints from the project contract. |
> | IMPLEMENT a component | Verify the configured behavior and accessibility requirements; use project tokens and abstractions only when defined. |
> | REVIEW UI code or a design artifact | Treat only applicable, authoritative clauses as fail-conditions; cite `UI-<clause>` + `file:line` + severity. NEVER turn inapplicable defaults into findings. |
> | SCAN / document a UI system | Record the project's actual platform conventions and deliberate deviations; do not fill gaps with this catalog's examples. |
>
> **Component architecture (code-bearing UI work):** Follow documented tiers and base abstractions when the project has them. Otherwise identify actual reuse boundaries from the code; do not require a three-tier taxonomy, base class, or lower-tier test model. Reuse shared behavior when a demonstrated consumer and suitable project abstraction justify it; test according to the project's test organization.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has no user-facing surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate -->

> **[BLOCKING] Design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) — binds on ANY task that designs, plans, mocks up, implements, or reviews a user-facing visual surface.** Deep catalog: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`.
>
> **Precedence (resolve in this order, never silently):** the **brief's own stated visual direction WINS outright** — including when it asks for one of the `DD-4` tells. Then the **project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs** — a house style IS an intentional identity; re-deciding it per feature is incoherence. Then these clauses. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Relationship to `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`:** the 40 clauses ask _"is this usable, accessible, consistent?"_ (a measurable floor); this gate asks _"is this THIS product's interface, or the one any generator would emit for any brief?"_. BOTH bind; where they touch (type scale, colour, motion timing) the clause sets the floor and this gate picks the value.
>
> - `DD-1` **Ground it in the subject matter.** Before designing, name the concrete subject, the audience, and the design's primary job — and CONFIRM with the user when the brief is silent. Distinctive choices come FROM the subject's industry, materials and vernacular, never taste applied on top. **Test: if the palette, type and layout would fit a different product unchanged, there is no identity yet.**
> - `DD-2` **Every choice carries a WHY.** "It's common", "it's clean", "users expect it" are not reasons; an unexplained decision is a default that arrived unnoticed. Defaults hide in infrastructure — typography, navigation, data display, and TOKEN NAMES. **Token-name test: someone reading only your CSS variables should be able to guess what product this is** (`--ink`/`--parchment` evoke a world; `--gray-700`/`--surface-2` evoke a template).
> - `DD-3` **Two passes, and the review pass is mandatory.** (1a) Write a compact **design plan** — Colour (4–6 named hex values) · Type (families + roles + scale) · Layout (one-sentence prose + ASCII wireframes to compare alternatives, including alignment: left/centre/justified) · Principles (what makes THIS page unique). (1b) **BLOCKING generic test — before any code:** work through a similar prompt and see whether you arrive somewhere similar; **any part that reads like the generic default for any comparable page rather than a choice for THIS brief gets REVISED, and you state what you changed and why.** Then (2a) build the REVISED plan, (2b) critique. — why: a plan taken straight to code reproduces the default it came from.
> - `DD-4` **Audit every FREE axis against the generated-design tell catalog** (`[model-knowledge]`, calibration not prohibition — each trait is legitimate for SOME brief): **T1** cream `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif + terracotta near `#D97757` (Anthropic's own interaction accent — on a user's brief it reads specifically as a tell) · **T2** near-black + one acid-green/vermilion accent · **T3** broadsheet hairline-rule pastiche, zero radius, dense columns · **T4** the SaaS-card kit: identical rounded cards, ONE radius regardless of hierarchy, the same `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` shadow under each, gradient washes as decoration · **T5** template chrome whatever the subject: tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots (`A · B · C`), `WORD — fragment` labels with a spaced em dash, tinted near-black (`#0B0B0B`/`#111`) standing in for black, monospace for small data labels, `→` appended to link/button text. **A match is a HYPOTHESIS about a missed decision, never a defect** — promote it only by naming the axis, that the brief left it free, and what the subject suggested instead.
> - `DD-5` **Typography carries the personality.** One family, or two CLEARLY distinct ones — you do NOT need separate display and body faces. Choose deliberately, set a real scale with intentional weights, widths and spacing; a headline is an ACTIVE part of the design. Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. Every device must tell the reader something whitespace would not, or it goes. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (uniform card size, gap and density is no one deciding); articulable proportions; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, workaround-only `calc()` values, and absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is simpler than the hack). Review screenshots where the environment supports it. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.

Deep detail: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` §8. Copy makes a design feel as templated as the visuals do.
>
> Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to SAY and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience. Then:
>
> 1. **Write from the end user's perspective.** Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built — a user manages **notifications**, not **webhook config**. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to a new user ALWAYS beats being clever.
> 2. **Active voice by default.** A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: **"Save changes"**, NEVER "Submit".
> 3. **One name per action, across the whole flow.** The button that says **Publish** produces a toast that says **Published**. The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product — cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.
> 4. **Failure and emptiness give DIRECTION, not mood.** Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. **Errors do NOT apologize, and are NEVER vague about what happened.** An empty screen is an invitation to act.
> 5. **Conversational tone, one job per element.** Plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, tone matched to the brand and the audience; let each written element do exactly one job.
> 6. **Real content, never lorem.** When the brief supplies no copy, write plausible strings for the ACTUAL subject. **Coherence check — read every visible string as a user would, checking for truth, not typos:** could a real person at a real company be looking at exactly this data right now, or does the page title belong to one product, the body to another, and the sidebar metrics to a third? A beautifully designed interface with nonsensical content is a movie set with no script.

This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (later) · `P4` note. Translate to other dialects (BLOCKED/WARN, Critical–Low, BLOCKING/ADVISORY) ONLY through the §0.3 severity map. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order — over whole SURFACES, not files (§0.5).** Map changed files to the pages/views/dialogs they render into, reconstruct each surface's composition (component tree + style origins; render when it can run, else `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), then sweep: §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & surface complexity (B12–B15: surface load, progressive disclosure, one job per view, the project's complexity budget) · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction and relevant product states · §E information architecture & container fit (E9–E11: dialog vs full view vs stepped flow vs side panel vs inline) · **§F web / §G mobile — conditional on platform; §H expert & data-heavy use — conditional on usage, not platform** · §I accessibility: use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, use the documented platform standard. Record the selected standard and its source; severity follows the governing release contract · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · **§R forms & data entry — conditional on input: fill the Field Necessity Matrix first** · §N edge-case probes. Make one focused pass per applicable section and record N/A with evidence for sections the surface does not support. Cluster a defect repeated across surfaces into ONE finding; calibrate against `.claude/docs/design-review-calibration.md`.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — use these prompts for applicable surfaces: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) is feedback timely against the project/platform expectation · (3) do relevant empty/loading/error states offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious and reachable for supported inputs · (5) do contrast and focus meet the selected accessibility standard (WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for web) · (6) can users operate the surface with its supported input modes · (7) do interactive targets meet the platform's size/spacing guidance · (8) are destructive actions recoverable where appropriate · (9) does the surface work at its smallest supported size and required zoom/reflow · (10) are there deceptive or coercive patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Component architecture pass (§M6–§M9) when source code is in scope.** Verify the ownership model documented or demonstrated by the project, reuse/composition decisions, and whether shared behavior is duplicated without a reason. Do not require tiers, a base abstraction, or a particular test hierarchy unless the project uses one. Report applicable checklist IDs with `file:line` evidence; do not infer source architecture from a screenshot alone.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains UI work, bind applicable acceptance criteria to the target platform/surface, relevant user states, and the selected accessibility standard. Each UI phase MUST name, per new or reshaped view: its primary task, its container (E9), its information priority (what is shown now / later / never here), and — for input — the inputs required at creation vs deferred (§R1–R2). A plan review treats a UI phase missing these as a finding against the checklist IDs it leaves unbound. Use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, identify the documented platform standard. Identify conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L) that apply. Do not require every catalogued state; record the standard and its source, and keep unsupported checks N/A.

<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness -->

> **Review Applicability / Current-Principles Awareness** — Every review must first classify the change context (greenfield foundation, brownfield feature/refactor, test/docs/config/UI/infra, or actor-facing/machine surface) and take notice of the applicable current principles below. This is an evidence-gated applicability check, not a mandate to flag or build every item.
>
> **Detailed protocol routing — read/apply only when warranted:**
> - `SYNC:scale-ready-foundation` — greenfield foundation is blocking; big-feature brownfield fit/adapt/defer; architecture review is advisory when auditing. Detailed carriers: `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-big-feature`.
> - `SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract` — assertion-bearing tests use the project's configured/native format, name the guarded intent/technical contract, and assert an owned outcome; GWT is one valid format. Detailed carriers: `integration-test`, `workflow-greenfield-init`, and the test-architecture review path.
> - `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access` — when an AI/machine actor or future contract is evidenced, inspect identity/delegation, capability boundaries, selected API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP/event/SDK surface, safety/consent, audit/observability, and native-format contract tests. Detailed carriers: `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-big-feature`, `architecture --mode=review`.
> - `SYNC:design-system-check` — when UI changes, inspect the design-system and component-contract obligations; route visual/UX depth to the owning UI review.
>
> **Review behavior:** Check only principles applicable to the reviewed scope; record `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNVERIFIED` with `file:line`/config/CI evidence, status/severity, owner/route, and next step/revisit trigger. Do not invent findings from a generic checklist, flag unrelated pre-existing gaps as regressions, silently expand the requested scope, or mutate a parent gate merely because advice exists.
>
> **Ownership:** `changes-review` coordinates the applicability pass and routes depth to the owning specialist (`architecture --mode=review`, `integration-test --mode=review`, `security-audit`, `performance-review`, `ui-design --mode=review`, `production-readiness-review`, or another matching review). A specialist reports its own lens and does not duplicate or override another review's verdict; existing brownfield gaps stay advisory unless new, safety-relevant, or explicitly in scope.
>
> **Required review note:** `context/scope | principle/protocol checked | evidence | status/verdict | severity | owner/route | next step/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED when:** an applicable principle is required for safety/correctness but missing, unowned, or untestable. Otherwise record an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE`, advisory, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, or `UNVERIFIED` result according to the lifecycle and change context; creating a greenfield foundation remains subject to its own blocking protocol.

<!-- SYNC:ux-journey-gate -->

> **[BLOCKING] Journey-first UX gate (`UX-1`–`UX-11`) — binds on ANY task that generates, specifies, plans, mocks up or reviews a user-facing surface.** Catalog (process, templates, methods, sources): `.claude/docs/ux-journey-process.md`. Each clause is a CHECK: record `PASS` / `FAIL → fixed` / `N/A (reason)` with evidence; cite findings as `UX-<n>` + location.
>
> **Order is BLOCKING: (1) REPORT the main user journeys → (2) READ the project's design principles, design system and existing UI → (3) only then generate → (4) CHECK every UI/UX gate (`UX-11`).** No wireframe, mockup, design plan, token table or UI code before step 1's report exists.
>
> - `UX-1` **Journey Report first.** Frame (problem · business goal · success signal · constraints) · actors (context, expertise, frequency) with job statements · 3–5 main journeys ranked by frequency × value × risk × first-use · per journey a step table (intent · decision · information needed · business rule · response · failure → recovery) · derived requirements · assumptions. Evidence from spec, stories, business logic, existing UI — each claim `SOURCED (location)` or `INFERRED`; CONFIRM an inferred primary actor, main job or success outcome with the user; no question tool → record it as `INFERRED — unconfirmed (no question tool)` in the assumptions and hand-off and continue — never block.
> - `UX-2` **Design authority read before generating.** Project design principles, design system (tokens, components, patterns), styling conventions, design ADRs, existing related UI — record `Design authority read: <paths>` or `N/A — none configured (checked: <paths>)`. Adopt house patterns; never invent what the project defines.
> - `UX-3` **Screens are journey steps.** Every view hosts ≥1 step and names its primary task; every main-journey step lands on a view; container fits the task (dialog only for short focused tasks).
> - `UX-4` **Important information first.** Per view, rank items by need-at-the-decision × frequency × cost-of-missing → Primary (the first read and first viewport: one focal point, ONE primary action = the journey's next step) · Secondary (visible, subdued) · On demand (progressive disclosure, always reachable) · Not here (owning view named). Front-load labels and headings so a scan of the first words finds the answer; never hide a high-cost-of-missing item on demand. Hierarchy implements the rank.
> - `UX-5` **Business rules become interaction.** Prevent before reporting: constraints, defaults, conditional visibility, permission-aware and state-driven actions, undo over confirm, confirm only the irreversible, async feedback; each step's failure and recovery path and each view's empty/loading/error states designed.
> - `UX-6` **Match the mental model.** User vocabulary · platform and house conventions · recognition over recall · few choices per decision · context carried across steps, never re-typed · accelerators for frequent experts.
> - `UX-7` **Low-fi before hi-fi.** Walk the main journeys on a structural sketch before the `DD-3` Design Plan and visual design.
> - `UX-8` **Walk the journeys.** Cognitive walkthrough per main journey on the result — does the user know the step is needed, see the action, link it to the goal, see progress? — plus a traceability matrix (step → view → element → tier → rule → states). Unserved step or orphan element = defect.
> - `UX-9` **Interaction cost per journey, measured.** Record per main journey: steps · clicks/taps · view changes · fields typed · decisions · waits — against the existing flow or the spec. Remove, default, merge or defer every interaction that does not advance the job; frequent journeys get the shortest path, rare ones may sit deeper. Click count alone is not the bar (the "3-click rule" is a myth): every click must be CONFIDENT — its label predicts the destination (information scent).
> - `UX-10` **Navigation and wayfinding.** Every view answers: where am I (current location marked), where can I go (labels in user words with strong scent), how do I get back or out (back/cancel/exit that keeps entered data). The navigation map has an entry for every journey, no dead ends or orphan views, works from a deep link, and keeps placement consistent; frequent destinations are one navigation action from where the journey starts.
> - `UX-11` **All UI/UX gates checked before hand-off.** Close every design output with a **UI/UX Gate Report**: one row per gate — `UX-1`–`UX-10` · `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` (floor, applicable clauses) · `DD-1`–`DD-8` (identity) · `CL-1`–`CL-6` (full sweep for a review, at least the `CL-5` triage otherwise) · UI copy — each `PASS` / `FAIL → fixed` / `FAIL — open` / `N/A (reason)` / `NOT VERIFIABLE` (never a guessed measurement) with evidence. An open `FAIL` blocks hand-off; an unlisted gate counts as not checked.
>
> **Depth scales with scope, never to zero:** tweak → 3–5 line journey note + the gate rows it touches · new/reshaped view → 1–2 journeys · new flow → full report · product → per capability. Recreation modes (screenshot/video) still infer and report the journeys and record violations the walk exposes. **Precedence:** accepted product decisions and the project's specs, design principles, design system and ADRs → the brief → these clauses; surface genuine conflicts to the user, NEVER resolve silently. **Sub-agents inherit nothing from this conversation:** a UI-bearing sub-agent brief carries the Journey Report and the Design Plan verbatim plus the design-system doc paths, or the leaf supplies its own defaults. **Skip ONLY** with no user-facing surface — state the reason.

<!-- /SYNC:ux-journey-gate -->

<!-- SYNC:core-engineering-principles -->

> **Core Engineering Principles — Easy to Change · Easy to Scale · Easy to Maintain** — The success metric of every plan, implementation and review is _future change cost_: the next change must be cheap, safe and provable. DRY, reuse, abstraction, interfaces, wrappers, patterns, layering, tests and the harness exist only to serve that goal. Apply this gate BEFORE any narrower design rule or checklist; when a narrower design rule would raise change cost, this principle wins — it never waives a required gate (tests, review, security, user confirmation). It is evidence-gated: judge fit against the project's config, accepted decisions and local patterns, and never impose a technique the project does not use.
>
> 1. **Easy to change.** Keep one owner per piece of knowledge — DRY the rule, not look-alike text. Reuse an existing helper, component or module before writing a new one (search 3+ siblings and cite them). Put purpose-named interfaces or ports at volatile boundaries: wrap a third-party SDK or infrastructure dependency in an adapter when it is volatile, likely to be swapped, or needs a test seam, so a swap touches one place — a stable dependency used directly is fine, and a pass-through wrapper that lowers no change cost is a defect. Keep units small and cohesive with explicit dependencies; no hidden state, boolean traps or leaked implementation detail. Extract an abstraction for a real second consumer or an evidenced change axis, never for speculation; prefer the reversible decision and defer an irreversible one until evidence forces it. Depth → `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:complexity-prevention`.
> 2. **Easy to scale.** Growth in features, modules, team, data or load must not multiply edit sites or cost. Add a variant by extension (a new handler, registration or config entry), not by editing every switch over the same discriminator. Keep module boundaries and dependency direction explicit. Bound every loop, query, result set, queue and concurrency on the paths that matter, so work grows with the request, not with total data. Scale only what the project's profile warrants — no speculative distribution or infrastructure. Depth → `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`, `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F5, F6).
> 3. **Easy to maintain.** Protect every changed behavior with tests that name the business intent or invariant and FAIL when it breaks — happy, error, edge, boundary and regression paths, not only the changed line. Tests are repeatable and isolated. The mechanical harness (format, lint, types, build, test — the same command locally and in CI) runs and passes. Names and structure state intent, and docs or specs that embed the behavior stay in sync. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F3, F4, F7), `SYNC:harness-setup`.
>
> **By phase:**
>
> - **Plan** — each phase names what it reuses (`file:line`), the seam or abstraction it adds or why none is needed, the next plausible change and its edit-site count, the growth bound, and the test that proves each invariant — or `N/A` with a reason where an item cannot apply (a docs-only phase has no growth bound).
> - **Implement** — search for reuse before writing; after writing, recount the edit sites of the next plausible change, confirm each new test fails when its intent breaks, and run the harness.
> - **Review** — judge each pillar `PASS` / `FAIL` / `N/A` with `file:line` evidence and name the real enemy: coupling, duplicated knowledge, hidden state, unbounded growth, untested intent, unclear intent or an irreversible decision exposed too early. A finding names its consequence for the next change; absence of a pattern is not a defect.
>
> **Self-check before claiming done:** (1) What is the next plausible change, and how many files would it touch? (2) What breaks at 10× features, data or load? (3) Which named test goes red if this behavior breaks, and does the harness run it?

<!-- SYNC:review-decision-autonomy -->

> **Review Decision Autonomy** — Applies to every review/audit skill, review mode and its orchestration, including report-only and terminal leaves. Complete the requested review with the best evidence-supported choices.
>
> **Decide and proceed.** Do not ask the user anything the reviewer can decide, infer from the task/repository, or recommend with supporting evidence. Choose the best option for the review goal, record the choice and its rationale, and continue. This includes scope defaults, applicable document sections, bounded slices, specialist applicability, verification strategy, recommended coverage/translation repairs, trade-offs and routine next steps. A recommendation is a decision to make, not a reason to ask the user to choose it.
>
> **Round-limit exception.** At three review rounds with MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL findings, unresolved required evidence or failed gates, ask through the host question tool whether to extend by a stated number of rounds or stop with the unresolved report. Wait for the answer. Read-only leaves hand this decision to the coordinator; no autonomous extension.
>
> **Evidence and authority.** Investigate uncertain choices and prefer the supported, reversible option within the requested scope. Record material costs, assumptions and residual risk; a reviewer decision is not user acceptance of an open finding. Preserve required source coverage, validation, tests, read-only boundaries and round limits. Choose a supported fallback when a tool or intake strategy fails; never turn an unavailable required check into PASS. Ask only for an indispensable missing fact with no defensible default or recommendation, or actual operation authorization/native permission that the session does not provide. A review does not authorize staging, committing, publishing, destructive actions, external spending or unrelated implementation.
>
> **Leaves and closure.** A read-only leaf decides its review approach and returns evidenced findings, its recommended remedy and genuine blockers to the owner; it neither asks the user nor applies fixes. The fixing owner executes the supported remedy within existing authority. Do not manufacture a next-step, trade-off-confirmation or minimum-question prompt before returning a completed review; return the report/verdict or continue the already-authorized workflow. At a hard stop, report the unresolved state; a round-budget extension requires an explicit user answer under `SYNC:review-policy`.
>
> **Question-rule precedence.** Within review/audit invocations, this protocol governs review-generated clarification, choice, confirmation and next-step prompts, including older mandatory-question wording in shared gates or mode references. It changes who selects a supported review decision, never the evidence bar or authority for the resulting action. Non-review creation, interviews and implementation retain their own contracts.

<!-- /SYNC:review-decision-autonomy -->

<!-- SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** use structured reasoning for complex or ambiguous work, implicitly when visible markers would clutter. Verify hypotheses, revise assumptions, and close with confidence, assumptions, open questions and a concrete next action.

<!-- /SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Derive each category's concerns from first principles with `file:line` evidence — never a fixed checklist.

<!-- /SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

**Review/audit invocations:** follow `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` for every decision prompt; choose supported recommendations without asking, preserve round-extension approval and actual authority.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `ask user question tool` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `ask user question tool` reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS. If you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- /SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ui-intent-layer:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** For UI-bearing specs, author/maintain the tech-agnostic interaction-surface layer (views with information priority now/later/not-here and container role + navigation map + observable states + user-action flows), resolving it through the configured profile's intent/evidence roles and logical IDs; an unresolved owner, role, ID, carrier, or link stays `UNKNOWN`/`BLOCKED`. **Strict portable fallback — only when neither config nor local references declares a native artifact contract:** trace each flow to the default `US-`/`OP-`/`BR-` IDs and record the companion artifact in the `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter keys. Name ZERO frameworks/routes/CSS/component classes; skip ONLY for backend-only features with a stated reason.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

The brief's stated direction OUTRANKS the tell catalog; project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — genuine conflicts go to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for surfaces with no user-facing visuals, stated explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ui-copywriting:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** treat user-visible words as design content: end-user vocabulary, not system vocabulary (notifications, not webhook config) · active-voice CTAs that say what happens ("Save changes", never "Submit") · ONE name per action across the whole flow (Publish → "Published") · errors explain what happened and how to fix it and NEVER apologize or stay vague, empty screens invite action · sentence case, plain verbs, no filler, one job per element · real subject-specific copy, never lorem — and read every string for TRUTH: one coherent story, not three products' content on one screen. Skip ONLY when no user-visible text changes, stated explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-copywriting:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

<!-- /SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce and review designs for the project's evidenced user-facing platforms, preserving accessibility, usability, and established visual language without imposing a web or styling stack.

**MUST ATTENTION Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this agent carries) — NEVER treat a digest line as the full rule; it signposts the canonical body above:**

- **Agent Bootstrap:** Task breakdown + progress file first.
- **Sequential Thinking:** Multi-step Thought N/M, confidence closer.
- **Understand Code First:** Read + grep 3+ before writing.
- **Evidence:** Cite `file:line`; >80% to act.
- **UI System Context:** Read frontend + SCSS + design-system docs.
- **UI Wireframe:** Process visual input; classify component tier.
- **Design System Check:** Read tokens/patterns before frontend work.
- **Design Patterns Quality:** DRY/SOLID; serial passes; 3+ extract.
- **Severity Rubric:** Classify Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence.
- **Category Review Thinking:** Derive concerns from first principles.
- **Post-fix brief:** re-read the whole target from scratch; the orchestrator owns the re-review loop.
- **Source/Test Drift:** Source change → inspect affected tests.
- **Graph-Assisted Investigation (optional):** the code graph is a stale-able hint for high-risk blast radius, never required.
- **UX Journey Gate:** `UX-1`–`UX-11` run FIRST — Journey Report → design authority read → generate; walk every main journey at the end.
- **UI/UX Design Principles:** 40 clauses `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`; IMPLEMENT role = the pre-completion gate in Key Rules; project design-system docs outrank them.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include accessibility review for every user-facing surface using the project's standard and the target platform's semantics, focus, contrast, and assistive-input guidance — why: accessibility gaps ship silently and block real users.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** verify responsive behavior only where the target platform supports multiple viewport/window sizes or form factors; cover the sizes and orientations configured or requested — why: platform constraints differ.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow configured styling and class naming; BEM is used only when selected by the project — why: a portable framework cannot prescribe one CSS methodology.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** reuse existing tokens and components when configured; read the canonical design-system doc when present, and do not invent a shared system for projects without one — why: established ownership prevents drift.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** verify control sizing and motion against the target platform, input method, and user preferences before marking the design complete — why: fixed web values do not fit every device.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing components/patterns before creating new and verify fit against the target platform, owner, and scope before copying — why: duplicate UI code adds maintenance without guaranteeing reuse.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every finding (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first); NEVER fabricate file paths, component names, or token names — investigate first — why: a guessed token/path silently corrupts the design system.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap a TaskCreate breakdown before edits, keep one task in_progress, and persist complex review/research findings incrementally to `tmp/reports/` — why: context exhaustion silently loses all findings.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read `frontend-patterns-reference.md` + `configured styling reference` + the design-system docs BEFORE implementing — project conventions override generic defaults — why: local patterns differ from framework assumptions.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER call an implemented user-facing change done before its applicable UI Pre-Completion Gate passes — interaction states · configured/platform sizing and spacing · measured contrast · perceivable focus/selection · input-appropriate controls · stable async layout · timely feedback and motion preferences · required input preservation. Skip ONLY when no user-facing surface is in scope — state that explicitly.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** project design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs OUTRANK the `UI-*` clauses — a genuine conflict goes to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently — why: the project's recorded decision is the authority; the clauses are the default only where it is silent.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                               | Rebuttal                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Small UI tweak, skip the a11y audit" | Check the applicable accessibility standard on every user-facing change, regardless of size. |
| "Desktop-first is faster here"        | Cover the view sizes and form factors the platform and project support; do not assume mobile-first or web breakpoints. |
| "A raw hex is fine just this once"    | Use configured tokens when present; otherwise follow the documented visual authority without inventing a token system. |
| "I'll reuse the nearest component"    | Verify fit against the documented project architecture, platform, and scope. Closest ≠ matching. |
| "Looks accessible to me"              | Show evidence against the applicable accessibility guidance. No proof = not verified. |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze scope and break it into small TaskCreate todos + a final review task; persist large review/research findings to `tmp/reports/`.

**MUST ATTENTION** follow the project's configured design and accessibility authorities; apply only metrics and styling methods appropriate to the target platform, and record when a UI check is not applicable.
