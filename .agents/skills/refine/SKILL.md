## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:START -->

> **[BLOCKING]** Execute skill steps in declared order. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval.
> **[BLOCKING]** Before each step or sub-skill call, update task tracking: set `in_progress` when step starts, set `completed` when step ends.
> **[BLOCKING]** Every completed/skipped step MUST include brief evidence or explicit skip reason.
> **[BLOCKING]** If Task tools are unavailable, create and maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with the same status transitions.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:END -->

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting. Simple tasks: ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings to `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence, confidence >80% to act.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Transform raw ideas into actionable PBIs using BA best practices, hypothesis validation, domain research.

**Workflow:**

| Phase | Name                | Key Activity                     | Output                 |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | Idea Intake         | Load artifact, detect module     | Context loaded         |
| 2     | Domain Research     | WebSearch market/competitors     | Research summary       |
| 3     | Problem Hypothesis  | Validate problem exists          | Confirmed hypothesis   |
| 4     | Elicitation         | Apply BABOK techniques           | Requirements extracted |
| 5     | Acceptance Criteria | Write BDD scenarios              | GIVEN/WHEN/THEN        |
| 6     | Prioritization      | Apply RICE/MoSCoW + Story Points | Priority + estimate    |
| 7     | Validation          | Interview user (MANDATORY)       | Assumptions confirmed  |
| 8     | PBI Generation      | Create artifact                  | PBI file saved         |

**Key Rules:**

- NEVER skip hypothesis validation for new features
- Validation interview NOT optional — always ask 3-5 questions
- Use project domain-specific vocabulary when available
- MUST ATTENTION include `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai` in PBI frontmatter
- Every PBI MUST ATTENTION include Dependencies table — types: `must-before` | `can-parallel` | `blocked-by` | `independent`
- `docs/specs/` — read existing TCs for related features; recommend test spec generation for new PBIs
- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — read when task involves business entities/models

---

## Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-system-context -->

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` (Codex has no hook injection — open this file directly before proceeding)
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

---

## Greenfield Mode

> **Auto-detected:** No code directories (`src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `packages/`, etc.) and no manifest files (`package.json`/`*.sln`/`go.mod`) found. Planning artifacts (docs/, plans/, .claude/) don't count.

**When greenfield detected:**

1. Skip existing backlog refinement (no backlog exists)
2. Enable DDD domain modeling: bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects
3. Capture constraints: team skills, expected scale, hosting preferences, budget — as input signals only
4. Use WebSearch for market research + competitor analysis
5. Output domain model artifact alongside PBI artifact
6. Increase ask the user directly frequency — validate domain boundaries, entity relationships, business rules
7. **[CRITICAL] NEVER ask about tech stack during refinement.** Tech stack decided after business analysis. Capture team skills + scale expectations as signals only.

**Be skeptical. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.**

---

## Phase 0: Locate Active Plan (if in workflow)

If running in workflow (big-feature, greenfield-init, etc.):

1. Glob `plans/*$plan-hard.md` sorted by modification time, or check the current task list for plan context
2. Read `plan.md` — project scope, goals, architecture decisions, domain model
3. Read existing research — `{plan-dir}$research/*.md` for business evaluation, domain analysis
4. Read `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` (if exists) — existing domain entities
5. Use plan context — don't re-ask questions already answered in prior steps

## Phase 1: Idea Intake & Context Loading

1. Read idea artifact from path or find by ID in `team-artifacts/ideas/`
2. Extract: problem statement, value proposition, target users, scope
3. Check `module` field; if absent, detect via keywords or prompt user

---

## Phase 2: Domain Research

**Trigger:** New domain, unclear competitors, `--research` flag.
**Skip:** Internal tooling, well-understood domain, time-constrained.

Use WebSearch with domain terms. Summarize in max 3 bullets (market context, competitors, best practices).

---

## Phase 3: Problem Hypothesis Validation

Validate hypothesis with user via ask the user directly. 42% of startups fail due to no market need — validate before building.

**Skip:** `--skip-hypothesis`, validated hypothesis exists, bug fix/tech debt.

### Problem Hypothesis Template

```markdown
**We believe** [target users/persona]
**Experience** [specific problem]
**Because** [root cause]
**We'll know this is true when** [validation metric/evidence]
```

### Value Hypothesis Template

```markdown
**We believe** [feature/solution]
**Will deliver** [value/benefit]
**To** [target users]
**We'll know we're right when** [success metric]
```

### Validation Process

1. Draft hypothesis from idea content
2. Use ask the user directly to validate:
    - "Is this the core problem we're solving?"
    - "Who exactly experiences this? How often?"
    - "What evidence do we have this problem exists?"
3. Validated → proceed to elicitation
4. Invalidated → return idea for clarification

---

## Phase 4: Requirements Elicitation (BABOK Core 5)

**Think:** What information gaps exist? Which technique fills them with least effort + highest confidence?

| Technique             | When to Choose                                      | What to Extract                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Interviews**        | Deep insights needed, stakeholder perspectives vary | Stakeholder needs, pain points, constraints     |
| **Workshops**         | Group consensus needed, multiple stakeholders       | Prioritized requirements, consensus decisions   |
| **Document Analysis** | Existing systems/processes, regulatory requirements | As-is state, compliance requirements, gaps      |
| **Observation**       | Users can't articulate needs, workflow unclear      | Actual vs stated workflow, hidden requirements  |
| **Prototyping**       | Visual validation needed, UI/UX requirements vague  | Validated UI requirements, interaction patterns |

**Technique notes:**

- Interviews: Open-ended questions (why, how, what-if) → active listening → follow-up on unexpected → document verbatim quotes
- Workshops: Define agenda + 90 min timebox → neutral facilitator → round-robin/silent voting → document decisions AND dissent
- Observation: Shadow users → note workarounds/pain points → don't interrupt → ask clarifying questions afterward

---

## Phase 5: Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)

Write GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios. Minimum 3: happy path, edge case, error case.

```gherkin
Scenario: {Descriptive title}
  Given {precondition/context}
    And {additional context}
  When {action/trigger}
    And {additional action}
  Then {expected outcome}
    And {additional verification}
```

| Practice                  | Rule                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Single trigger            | "When" clause has ONE action      |
| 3 scenarios minimum       | Happy path, edge case, error case |
| No implementation details | Behavior, not how                 |
| Testable outcomes         | "Then" must be verifiable         |
| Stakeholder language      | No technical jargon               |

### Example Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Employee creates goal with valid data
  Given employee has permission to create goals
    And employee is on the goal creation page
  When employee submits goal form with all required fields
  Then goal is created with status "Draft"
    And goal appears in employee's goal list

Scenario: Goal creation fails with missing required field
  Given employee is on the goal creation page
  When employee submits form without title
  Then validation error "Title is required" is displayed
    And goal is not created

Scenario: Manager reviews subordinate goal
  Given manager has direct reports
    And subordinate has submitted goal for review
  When manager opens goal review page
  Then subordinate's goal is visible with "Pending Review" status
```

### Project Test Case Format

- **Format:** `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` (e.g., TC-GM-001)
- **Evidence:** `file:line` format
- See `business-analyst` skill for detailed patterns

---

### Phase 5.5: Testability Assessment

Use a direct user question with 2-3 questions:

1. "Which testing approach fits this PBI?"
    - TDD-first: Write test specs before implementation (Recommended for complex features)
    - Implement-first: Build feature, then create test specs
    - Parallel: Spec and implement simultaneously

2. "What test levels are needed?"
    - Integration tests only (Recommended for backend CQRS)
    - Integration + E2E
    - Unit + Integration + E2E

For EACH acceptance criterion, generate corresponding test case outline:

| AC   | Test Outline                                            | Priority |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| AC-1 | TC: Create goal with valid data → verify persisted      | P0       |
| AC-2 | TC: Create goal without title → verify validation error | P1       |

Seed for `$tdd-spec` if user chooses TDD-first. Document in PBI under `## Testability Assessment`.

## Phase 6: Prioritization & Estimation

<!-- SYNC:estimation-framework -->

> **Estimation Framework** — Bottom-up first; SP DERIVED; output min-max range when likely ≥3d. Stack-agnostic. Baseline: 3-5yr dev, 6 productive hrs/day. AI estimate assumes Claude Code + project context.
>
> **Method:**
>
> 1. **Blast Radius pass** (below) — drives code AND test cost
> 2. Decompose phases → hours/phase → `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours`
> 3. `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6) × productivity_factor`
> 4. Sum **Risk Margin** (base + add-ons) → `max_days = likely_days × (1 + margin)`
> 5. `min_days = likely_days × 0.9`
> 6. Output as range when `likely_days ≥3`; single point allowed `<3` (still record margin)
> 7. `man_days_ai` = same range × AI speedup
> 8. `story_points` DERIVED from `likely_days` via SP-Days — NEVER driver. Disagreement >50% → trust bottom-up
>
> **Productivity factor:** 0.8 strong scaffolding+codegen+AI hooks · 1.0 mature default · 1.2 weak patterns · 1.5 greenfield
>
> **Cost Driver Heuristic (apply BEFORE work-type row):**
>
> - **UI dominates** in CRUD/business apps — 1.5-3x backend (states, validation, responsive, a11y, polish)
> - **Backend dominates ONLY:** multi-aggregate invariants, cross-service contracts, schema migrations, heavy query/perf, new event flows
>
> **Reuse-vs-Create axis (PRIMARY lever, per layer):**
>
> | UI tier                                      | Cost     |

> | Compose components into NEW screen           | 1-2d     |
> | NEW screen, custom layout/states/validation  | 2-4d     |
> | NEW shared/common component (themed, tested) | 3-6d+    |
>
> | Backend tier                                         | Cost      |
> | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
> | Reuse query/handler from new place                   | 0.1-0.3d  |
> | Small update existing handler/entity                 | 0.3-0.8d  |
> | NEW query on existing repo/model                     | 0.5-1d    |
> | NEW command/handler on existing aggregate (additive) | 1-2d      |
> | NEW aggregate/entity (repo, validation, events)      | 2-4d      |
> | NEW cross-service contract OR schema migration       | 2-4d each |
> | Multi-aggregate invariant / heavy domain rule        | 3-5d      |
>
> **Rule:** Sum tiers across UI+backend+tests, apply productivity factor. Reuse short-circuits tiers — call out.
>
> **Test-Scope drivers (compute test_count EXPLICITLY — "+tests" hand-wave is #1 failure):**
>
> | Driver                            | Count                                                  |

> | State-machine transitions         | reachable transitions × allowed actors                 |
> | Multi-entity state combos         | state(A) × state(B) — REACHABLE only, not Cartesian    |
> | Authorization matrix              | (owner, non-owner, elevated, unauth) × each mutation   |
> | Validation rules                  | 1 per required field / boundary / format / cross-field |
> | UI states (per new screen/dialog) | happy, loading, empty, error, partial — present only   |

> 2. Of those, "complex" (>500 LOC, multi-handler, central, frequently-modified) — count
> 3. Downstream consumers (callers, event subscribers, cross-service) — list
> 4. Shared/common code touched (multi-app blast) — yes/no

## Phase 7: Validation Interview (MANDATORY)

Generate 3-5 questions covering assumptions, scope, dependencies, edge cases. Use ask the user directly. Document in PBI. **NOT optional.**

| Category            | Example Question                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assumptions**     | "We assume X is true. Correct?"                                             |
| **Scope**           | "Should Y be included or explicitly excluded?"                              |
| **Dependencies**    | "This requires Z. Is that available?"                                       |
| **Edge Cases**      | "What happens when data is empty/null?"                                     |
| **Business Impact** | "Will this affect existing reports/workflows?"                              |
| **Entities**        | "Create new entity or extend existing X?"                                   |
| **Prod Readiness**  | "Does this feature need linting, error handling, loading, or Docker setup?" |
| **Authorization**   | "Who can perform this action? What roles/permissions are needed?"           |
| **Seed Data**       | "Does this feature need reference/lookup data to function?"                 |
| **Data Migration**  | "Does this change entity schema? Is data transformation needed?"            |

1. Generate 3-5 questions from assumptions, scope, dependencies
2. Use a direct user question to interview
3. Document in PBI under `## Validation Summary`
4. Update PBI based on answers

## Cross-Cutting & Production Readiness

> Capture in PBI template sections: Production Readiness Concerns, Authorization & Access Control, Seed Data, Data Migration.

<!-- SYNC:scaffold-production-readiness -->

> **Scaffold Production Readiness** — Every scaffolded project MUST ATTENTION include 5 foundations:
>
> 1. **Code Quality Tooling** — linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, CI gates. Specific tool choices → `docs/project-reference/` or `project-config.json`.
> 2. **Error Handling Foundation** — HTTP interceptor, error classification (4xx/5xx taxonomy), user notification, global uncaught handler.
> 3. **Loading State Management** — counter-based tracker (not boolean toggle), skip-token for background requests, 300ms flicker guard.
> 4. **Docker Development Environment** — compose profiles (`dev`/`test`/`infra`), multi-stage Dockerfile, health checks on all services, non-root production user.
> 5. **Integration Points** — document each outbound boundary; configure retry + circuit breaker + timeout; integration tests for happy path and failure path.
>
> **BLOCK `$cook` if any foundation is unchecked.** Present 2-3 options per concern via a direct user question before implementing.

<!-- /SYNC:scaffold-production-readiness -->

<!-- SYNC:cross-cutting-quality -->

> **Cross-Cutting Quality** — Check across all changed files:
>
> 1. **Error handling consistency** — same error patterns across related files
> 2. **Logging** — structured logging with correlation IDs for traceability
> 3. **Security** — no hardcoded secrets, input validation at boundaries, auth checks present
> 4. **Performance** — no N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, or blocking calls in async paths
> 5. **Observability** — health checks, metrics, tracing spans for new endpoints

<!-- /SYNC:cross-cutting-quality -->

## Phase 7.5: Re-evaluate Estimation (MANDATORY — runs after Validation Interview)

> **Why this phase exists:** Phase 6 estimation runs against a draft scope. Phase 7 (Validation Interview) and Cross-Cutting capture often resolve unknowns, add constraints, or trim/expand scope. The numbers in `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai` MUST be re-derived against the locked scope BEFORE Phase 8 writes them into the PBI frontmatter. Estimating once at draft and forgetting is the #1 source of estimation drift in PBIs.

### Inputs (locked by end of Phase 7)

- Confirmed assumptions, scope inclusions/exclusions
- Authorization, seed data, migration, prod-readiness decisions
- Newly discovered dependencies or edge cases
- Any rescoping the user requested during validation

### Re-derive (per `SYNC:estimation-framework`)

1. Walk the **locked** scope acceptance criteria + cross-cutting concerns; assign hours per slice.
2. `bottom_up_hours = Σ slice_hours` (use the SP table mapping in Phase 6, not eyeballing).
3. `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6)` × productivity factor for the team/AI mode.
4. Recompute `risk_margin_pct` based on remaining unknowns AFTER Phase 7 (margin should usually shrink because validation removed unknowns; rises only if new risks surfaced).
5. Recompute `min-max range` from the new likely_days ± margin.
6. Re-pick the closest Fibonacci `story_points` and `complexity` bucket from the re-derived likely_days.

### Compare against Phase 6 draft estimate

Compute `delta_pct = (new_likely_days - draft_likely_days) / draft_likely_days × 100`.

| Delta             | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\|delta\| ≤ 20%` | Keep draft estimate. Note `reestimate_delta_pct: <signed>` + `reestimate_reason: "within tolerance, no change"` in PBI frontmatter for transparency.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `\|delta\| > 20%` | UPDATE `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai`. Add `reestimate_delta_pct: <signed>` + 1-line `reestimate_reason` explaining what changed (e.g., "auth scope confirmed wider", "seed data dropped per validation").                                                                                   |
| `\|delta\| > 50%` | UPDATE values AND flag `SHOULD-RESCOPE`. Surface to user via a direct user question BEFORE Phase 8 writes the PBI: "Re-estimate is +/-X% vs original. Options: (a) accept new estimate as-is, (b) split into 2 PBIs, (c) trim scope back to original estimate, (d) defer." Record the user's decision in `## Validation Summary`. |

### Output

- Updated estimation values (carry into Phase 8 frontmatter)
- New frontmatter fields: `reestimate_delta_pct`, `reestimate_reason` (always populate even when within tolerance — creates a paper trail for retrospective comparison against actual implementation time)
- If rescoped: updated acceptance criteria/scope sections reflecting the user's choice

> **DO NOT skip this phase.** A PBI that ships with stale Phase 6 estimates is the source of unreliable velocity data. The whole point is to make the post-validation numbers — not the pre-validation guesses — the ones the team commits to.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                   | Better Approach                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Refining vague ideas           | Return to `$idea` for clarification |
| Skipping hypothesis validation | Always run Phase 3 for new features |
| Solution-first thinking        | Start with problem, not solution    |
| Generic acceptance criteria    | Use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN with specifics  |
| Ignoring domain context        | Load project docs if applicable     |
| Too large PBI (XL+)            | Break into smaller items            |
| Missing "Out of Scope"         | Explicitly list exclusions          |
| Assuming instead of asking     | Run validation interview            |

---

## Key Rules

- **Every PBI MUST ATTENTION include Dependencies table** — types: `must-before`, `can-parallel`, `blocked-by`, `independent`. Enables `$prioritize` and `$plan-hard` to respect ordering.
- **No vague dependency descriptions** — Each dependency must specify concrete PBI, service, or feature and WHY relationship exists.

## Definition of Ready (INVEST)

| Criterion           | Check                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **I**ndependent     | No blocking dependencies     |
| **N**egotiable      | Details can be refined       |
| **V**aluable        | Clear user/business value    |
| **E**stimable       | Team can estimate (XS-XL)    |
| **S**mall           | Single sprint                |
| **T**estable        | 3+ GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios |
| Problem Validated   | Hypothesis confirmed         |
| Domain Context      | BR/entity context loaded     |
| Stakeholder Aligned | Validation interview done    |
| Prod Readiness      | Concerns documented          |

## Project Integration

For domain PBIs: detect module from `docs/business-features/` directory names, extract business rules from `docs/business-features/{module}/`, load entity context from feature doc. Target 8-12K tokens for feature context.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after completing this skill, use a direct user question to present these options. NEVER skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious":

- **"$why-review (Recommended)"** — Validate design rationale, alternatives, risk assessment before `$story` or implementation
- **"$domain-analysis"** — If PBI creates/modifies domain entities, model bounded contexts before writing stories
- **"$story"** — Break PBI into implementable user stories
- **"$pbi-mockup"** — Generate HTML mockup from PBI
- **"$tdd-spec"** — If using TDD approach
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small tasks via task tracking BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via a direct user question — NEVER auto-decide
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add final review task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add task: run `$why-review` — validate PBI design rationale before `$story` or `$tdd-spec`
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add task: run `$pbi-challenge` — Dev BA PIC review before `$dor-gate` or `$story`

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Simple PBI, skip hypothesis validation"  | Wrong assumption wastes more time than validation check. Apply always.         |
| "Validation interview is optional here"   | NEVER optional — user decides assumptions, AI doesn't                          |
| "Skip Dependencies table, no blockers"    | Unknown blockers exist. Always fill table — even if `independent`              |
| "Skip story points, just write ACs"       | `story_points`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai` mandatory in frontmatter |
| "Domain context not needed for small PBI" | Small PBIs touch entities. Read domain-entities-reference first                |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
