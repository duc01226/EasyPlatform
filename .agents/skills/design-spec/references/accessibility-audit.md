# Accessibility Audit Report

Read when producing an accessibility-audit deliverable. Resolve the target platform and governing standard first: WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus stricter applicable requirements; non-web uses its documented platform standard. Record source and coverage; unmeasured values remain `NOT VERIFIABLE`.

This checklist is a starting inventory, not exhaustive conformance proof. Add every applicable criterion from the selected standard; record N/A with reasons and untested coverage as `NOT VERIFIABLE`. Do not mark PASS until required coverage is verified.

## Report Format

For an accessibility-audit deliverable, produce this checklist report and save it as `{YYMMDD}-ux-audit-{feature-slug}.md`:

```markdown
## Accessibility Audit: {Feature}
