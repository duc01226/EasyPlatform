> Codex compatibility note:
>
> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - User-question prompts mean to ask the user directly in Codex.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, execute each listed child-skill step explicitly and report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.

## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze all file changes between git branches, perform impact analysis, and update specification documents.

**Workflow:**

1. **Discovery** — Run git diff/log, classify changes (Frontend/Backend, Feature/Bugfix)
2. **Knowledge Graph** — Document each changed file with dependencies, impact level, service context
3. **Analysis** — Code review (strengths, weaknesses, security), refactoring recommendations
4. **Approval Gate** — Present findings for explicit approval before updating specs
5. **Spec Update** — Update requirements, tests, architecture docs based on approved analysis

**Key Rules:**

- All analysis must be evidence-based from actual git diffs
- Proceed past the approval gate only after explicit user approval, never before

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Branch Comparison & Specification Update

You are to operate as an expert full-stack dotnet angular principle developer, software architect, and technical analyst to analyze all file changes between branches, perform comprehensive impact analysis, and update specification documents.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

---

## PHASE 1: EXTERNAL MEMORY-DRIVEN BRANCH ANALYSIS

Build a structured knowledge model in `.ai/workspace/analysis/[comparison-name].analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND DISCOVERY

1. **Initialize** the analysis file with standard headings

### GIT BRANCH ANALYSIS DISCOVERY

**GIT_DIFF_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS**: Start with systematic git change detection:

1. **Primary Change Detection Commands**:

```bash
git diff --name-status [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git diff --stat [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git log --oneline [source-branch]..[target-branch]
```

Document results under `## Git Diff Analysis` and `## Commit History`.

2. **Change Impact & Scope Classification**: Document under `## Change Classification` and `## Change Scope Analysis`:
    - Types: Frontend, Backend, Config, DB
    - Purpose: Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor

**RELATED_FILES_COMPREHENSIVE_DISCOVERY**: For each changed file, discover all related components:

- Importers
- Dependencies
- Test files
- API consumers
- UI components

Save ALL changed files AND related files to `## Comprehensive File List` with:

- `filePath`
- `changeType`
- `relationshipType`
- `impactLevel`
- `serviceContext`

**INTELLIGENT_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT**: If file list exceeds 75, prioritize by impactLevel (Critical > High > Medium > Low).

### PHASE 1B: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

**IMPORTANT: MUST ATTENTION DO WITH TODO LIST**

For each file, document in `## Knowledge Graph`:

- All standard fields from feature-implementation skill
- Focus on change-specific context

### PHASE 1C: OVERALL ANALYSIS

Write comprehensive summary showing:

- Complete end-to-end workflows discovered
- Key architectural patterns and relationships
- Business logic workflows affected
- Integration points and dependencies

---

## PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING

Generate detailed analysis under these headings:

### 1. Code Review Analysis

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Security concerns
- Performance implications
- Maintainability

### 2. Refactoring Recommendations

- Immediate improvements
- Structural changes
- Technical debt items

### 3. Specification Update Plan

- New Requirements Discovery
- Test Specification Updates
- Documentation Strategy

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present comprehensive analysis, code review, refactoring recommendations, and specification update plan for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 4: SPECIFICATION UPDATE EXECUTION

Once approved, read existing specification document and update with:

- Requirements
- Test Specifications
- Architecture Documentation
- Code Review findings

---

## SUCCESS VALIDATION

Verify updated specification accurately reflects all changes. Document under `## Specification Validation`.

---

## Branch Comparison Guidelines

- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Start with `git diff` and base all updates on concrete code changes
- **Comprehensive Impact Assessment**: Analyze direct and indirect effects, including cross-service impacts
- **Enterprise Architecture Awareness**: Respect platform patterns, CQRS, and Clean Architecture
- **Quality-Focused Approach**: Perform thorough code review and identify refactoring opportunities
- **Specification Completeness**: Ensure full traceability between code, requirements, and tests

## Related

- `commit`
- `code-review`

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning -->

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line`, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
> 2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
> 3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Evidence file path (`file:line`) `- [ ]` Grep search performed `- [ ]` 3+ similar patterns found `- [ ]` Confidence level stated
>
> **Forbidden without proof:** "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because"
> **If incomplete →** output: `"Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."`

<!-- CODEX:SYNC-PROMPT-PROTOCOLS:START -->

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/hooks/lib/prompt-injections.cjs` + `.claude/.ck.json`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure unless the user explicitly invoked a workflow/skill and the local protocol treats explicit invocation as confirmation:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
