## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Turn a vague product idea into a validated, tech-agnostic, module-anchored backlog artifact ready for `$refine` to convert into a PBI — preserving problem intent without leaking solution or stack choices.

**Summary:**

- Two interview gates are NON-NEGOTIABLE: Discovery Interview (Step 6.5, 3-5 a direct user question items incl. the always-on testability question) AND Validation (Step 7, 2-3 items) — never skip either even for "simple" ideas.
- Keep the problem statement strictly tech-agnostic (M1): name no framework/product/language/pattern, and do NOT assign logical IDs — the downstream PBI inherits the clean narrative and owns `FR-`/`BR-` assignment.
- Auto-detect the project module silently via `Glob("docs/specs/*/README.md")` and load feature context (8-12K token budget); prompt only when ambiguous. Greenfield (no real code dirs) → skip module detection and NEVER ask about tech stack.
- Persist to `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md` with `t_shirt_size`, then hand off to `$refine` for PBI conversion.

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** task tracking task to READ project-specific reference doc:
> `project-structure-reference.md` — project patterns and structure. Not found → search: project documentation, coding standards, architecture docs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Gather Info** — Ask problem, value, scope, target users
2. **Generate Artifact** — Create idea file with ID (`IDEA-YYMMDD-NNN`) + draft status
3. **Detect Module** — Auto-match project module, load feature context from docs
4. **Discovery Interview** — a direct user question 3-5 structured questions (MANDATORY)
5. **Validate** — Confirm problem statement, scope, stakeholders (MANDATORY)
6. **Suggest Next** — Point to `$refine` for PBI creation

**Key Rules:**

- Output: `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`
- Validation NEVER optional — MANDATORY step
- Auto-detect module silently; prompt only when ambiguous
- MUST ATTENTION include `t_shirt_size` (XS/S/M/L/XL) in artifact for early sizing
- **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic output (M1):** the problem statement stays tech-agnostic per `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3 (all modes, not only greenfield) — name no framework/product/language/design-pattern; defer any stack preference to the later tech-research phase.
- **M3 Logical-ID Assignment (forward to PBI):** See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for BLOCKING criteria. An idea is a tech-agnostic business-intent definition only — do NOT assign logical IDs yet. When the idea advances to a PBI (via `$refine`), the PBI assigns logical IDs (`FR-`/`BR-`) as the PRIMARY citation spine and tracks `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract-anchor evidence (never physical code coordinates or repository-root paths) in a SEPARATE carrier from the business-intent prose. Keep the idea's problem/value narrative free of source identifiers so the PBI can inherit it cleanly.

## Greenfield Mode

> **Auto-detected:** No codebase found (no discovered source directories, no manifest files, no populated `project-config.json`) → greenfield mode. Planning artifacts (`docs/`, `plans/`, `.claude/`) don't count — repository must have actual code directories with content.

**When greenfield detected:**

1. Skip module auto-detection (no modules exist yet)
2. Skip `project-structure-reference.md` read (won't exist)
3. Focus broader problem-space: market gap, competitors, differentiation
4. Output tech-agnostic problem statement
5. Enable WebSearch for market/competitor context
6. Increase a direct user question frequency — capture vision, constraints, team profile, scale expectations
7. **[CRITICAL] NEVER ask about tech stack during idea capture.** Tech stack = research-driven decision AFTER full business analysis (business-evaluation phase). User volunteers preference → acknowledge but defer to tech stack research phase.

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

- No title → ask: "What's the idea in one sentence?"
- Ask: "What problem does this solve?"
- Ask: "Who benefits from this?"
- Ask: "Any initial scope thoughts?"

### Step 2: Generate Artifact

- Template: `.claude/docs/team-artifacts/templates/idea-template.md`
- ID: `IDEA-{YYMMDD}-{NNN}` (sequential)
- Status: `draft`

### Step 3: Capture Details

- Document problem statement, expected value, target users

### Step 4: Detect Project Module

**Dynamic Discovery:**

1. Run: `Glob("docs/specs/*/README.md")`
2. Extract module names from paths
3. Match idea keywords against module keywords

| Scenario             | Action                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear match          | Auto-detect — NEVER show confidence levels                                      |
| Ambiguous / no match | Prompt: "Which project module?" + Glob results + "Cross-cutting/Infrastructure" |
| 2+ modules detected  | Load ALL modules, add all to `related_features`                                 |

**If module detected:**

1. Read `docs/specs/{module}/README.md` (first 200 lines)
2. Extract feature list from Quick Navigation section
3. Add to frontmatter: `module: {detected_module}`, `related_features: [Feature1, Feature2]`

### Step 5: Load Feature Context

1. Read module README overview (~2K tokens)
2. Identify closest matching feature(s)
3. Read corresponding feature doc (3-5K tokens)
4. Extract: related entities, existing business rules (BR-{MOD}-XXX), test case patterns (TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN})

**Token Budget:** Target 8-12K tokens total.

### Step 6: Save Artifact

- Path: `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`
- Role: infer from context or ask
- Include domain context if detected

> **Artifact Path (canonical convention)** — Command `$idea` → base path `team-artifacts/ideas/`, role token `po`, type `idea`. Filename pattern: `{YYMMDD}-{role}-{type}-{slug}.md` → e.g. `260119-po-idea-dark-mode-toggle.md`. Slug = lowercased basename, non-alphanumeric → `-`, trimmed, max 50 chars.

### Step 6.5: Discovery Interview (MANDATORY)

Use a direct user question — 3-5 structured questions. Each MUST ATTENTION have 2-4 options with one marked "(Recommended)".

| Category        | Purpose                           | Example                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Problem Clarity | Distinguish problem from solution | "What problem does this solve?" + options |
| User Persona    | Identify primary user             | "Who benefits most?" + role options       |
| Scope           | MVP vs full vision                | "What's smallest valuable version?"       |
| Testability     | Define done?                      | "How would you verify this works?"        |
| Impact          | Business value sizing             | "How many users/processes affected?"      |
| Constraints     | Known blockers                    | "Any technical/business constraints?"     |
| Scale           | Expected load/growth              | "How many users/transactions expected?"   |

> **Greenfield:** NEVER include tech stack questions. Focus on business problem, users, scale, constraints.

**Testability Question (ALWAYS include):**
"How would you verify this feature works correctly?" — Options: manual test steps, automated test criteria, metric thresholds.

Document all answers under `## Discovery Interview`.

### Step 7: Validate Idea (MANDATORY)

a direct user question — 2-3 validation questions:

| Category     | Example Question                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem      | "Is the problem statement clear and user-focused?"    |
| Value        | "What's the expected business value or user benefit?" |
| Scope        | "Any scope boundaries to clarify now?"                |
| Stakeholders | "Who else should review this idea?"                   |

Document under `## Validation Summary`. Update artifact based on answers.

**Validation Output Format:**

```markdown
## Validation Summary

**Validated:** {date}

### Confirmed

- {decision}: {user choice}

### Action Items

- [ ] {follow-up if any}
```

### Step 8: Suggest Next Step

a direct user question after capture:

1. `$refine` — Refine into PBI (Recommended)
2. `$spec [mode=tests]` — Jump straight to test spec
3. `$plan` — Start implementation planning

Output: "Idea captured! To refine into a PBI, run: `$refine {filename}`"
Module detected: "Module context from {module} will be used during refinement."

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** Not already in workflow → MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-idea-to-pbi` workflow** (Recommended) — idea → refine → review-artifact --type=pbi → story → review-artifact --type=story → prioritize
> 2. **Execute `$idea` directly** — run standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing skill, use a direct user question:

- **"$refine (Recommended)"** — Transform idea into actionable PBI
- **"$web-research"** — Idea needs market research first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** task tracking break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks each file read. Simple tasks: AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review) → write intermediate findings to `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss, serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence, confidence percentage (>80% act, <80% verify first).

<!-- SYNC:ui-wireframe -->

> **UI Wireframe** — Process visual design input (Figma URLs, screenshots, wireframes) via appropriate tool BEFORE creating wireframes. Use box-drawing ASCII characters for spatial layout. Classify every component into exactly ONE tier: Common (cross-app reusable) / Domain-Shared (cross-domain) / Page (single-page). Duplicate UI code = wrong tier. Search existing component libraries before creating new (>=80% match = reuse). Detail level varies by skill (idea=rough, story=full decomposition).

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Turn a vague product idea into a validated, tech-agnostic, module-anchored backlog artifact ready for `$refine` to convert into a PBI — preserving problem intent without leaking solution or stack choices.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **UI Wireframe:** classify each component into ONE tier; search libs first, reuse ≥80% match.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced proof per claim; confidence >80% to act; never present guess as fact.
- **Sequential Thinking:** multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers and confidence closer.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Discovery Interview (Step 6.5) + Validation (Step 7) NEVER optional — run BOTH a direct user question gates even for "simple" ideas — why: discovery uncovers hidden constraints, validation confirms problem framing; different question categories
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ALWAYS keep problem statement tech-agnostic (M1, `spec-principles.md` §3, all modes) — name no framework/product/language/design-pattern; defer any stack preference to the later tech-research phase — why: PBI inherits the narrative cleanly downstream
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** in greenfield mode NEVER ask about tech stack — acknowledge a volunteered preference, then defer to the business-evaluation phase — why: stack is a research-driven decision after business analysis, not a capture-time guess
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** task tracking break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including a task to READ `project-structure-reference.md` (skip in greenfield — it won't exist)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate all decisions with user via a direct user question — NEVER auto-decide — and NEVER show confidence levels on an auto-detected module match
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** auto-detect module silently via `Glob("docs/specs/*/README.md")` — prompt only when ambiguous or no match; greenfield → skip module detection — why: confirm with `Glob()` evidence, not assumption
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** assign NO logical IDs (M3) — an idea is tech-agnostic business intent only; the downstream PBI owns `FR-`/`BR-` assignment and `[Source: namespace/service/id]` anchors — why: keep the problem/value narrative free of source identifiers so the PBI inherits it cleanly
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include `t_shirt_size` (XS/S/M/L/XL) in the artifact and keep the feature-context load within the 8-12K token budget — why: early sizing feeds prioritization; over-budget reads dilute attention
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** persist to `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`, then hand off to `$refine` for PBI conversion — why: canonical path keeps downstream tooling aligned
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search existing component libraries before proposing any new UI component (≥80% match = reuse); classify each into exactly ONE tier — why: duplicate UI code = wrong tier
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence for every claim/recommendation, confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first — why: certainty without evidence is the root of hallucination
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify work quality

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                      | Rebuttal                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Idea is simple, skip interview"             | NEVER skip — discovery uncovers hidden constraints                      |
| "Module is obvious, skip detection"          | Still run `Glob()` — confirm with evidence not assumption               |
| "Validation is redundant after interview"    | ALWAYS run both — different question categories                         |
| "Greenfield check is optional"               | Auto-detect is MANDATORY — no manual override                           |
| "User mentioned a framework, capture it"     | Stay tech-agnostic — acknowledge, defer to tech-research phase          |
| "I'll assign FR-/BR- IDs now"                | NO logical IDs at idea stage — the PBI assigns them downstream          |
| "Reuse an existing component? new is faster" | Search libs first — ≥80% match = reuse; new without search = wrong tier |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the 3 rules to never skip: (1) run BOTH Discovery + Validation a direct user question gates; (2) keep the problem statement tech-agnostic (no stack/IDs); (3) cite `file:line` evidence, confidence >80% to act.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
  **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
