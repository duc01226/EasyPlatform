## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Enhance code documentation, API docs, README files, and technical writing with verified accuracy.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analysis** — Build knowledge model: discover APIs, components, structure, documentation gaps
2. **Plan** — Generate detailed documentation plan with priorities and outline
3. **Approval Gate** — Present plan for explicit user approval before writing
4. **Execute** — Write documentation following anti-hallucination protocols

**Key Rules:**

- Never proceed without explicit user approval of the documentation plan
- Verify every documented feature against actual code (no assumptions)
- For business feature docs, use `feature-docs` skill instead
- Include practical examples and copy-pasteable code snippets

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

> **Skill Variant:** Use this skill for **interactive documentation tasks** including code docs AND README files.

## Disambiguation

- For **business feature docs** → use `feature-docs`
- This skill covers **code documentation** and **README files**

# Documentation Enhancement

You are to operate as an expert technical writer and software documentation specialist to enhance documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning -->

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line`, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
> 2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
> 3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Evidence file path (`file:line`) `- [ ]` Grep search performed `- [ ]` 3+ similar patterns found `- [ ]` Confidence level stated
>
> **Forbidden without proof:** "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because"
> **If incomplete →** output: `"Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."`

## PHASE 1: EXTERNAL MEMORY-DRIVEN DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

Build a structured knowledge model in `.ai/workspace/analysis/[task-name].analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND DISCOVERY

1. **Initialize** the analysis file with standard headings
2. **Discovery searches** for all related files

### DOCUMENTATION-SPECIFIC DISCOVERY

**DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETENESS_DISCOVERY**: Focus on documentation-relevant patterns:

1. **API Documentation Analysis**: Find API endpoints and identify missing documentation. Document under `## API Documentation`.

2. **Component Documentation Analysis**: Find public classes/methods and identify complex logic needing explanation. Document under `## Component Documentation`.

3. **Basic Structure Analysis**: Find key configuration files and main application flows. Document under `## Structure Documentation`.

**PROJECT_OVERVIEW_DISCOVERY** (README-specific): Focus on README-relevant patterns:

1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Find entry points, map key directories, identify technologies
2. **Feature Discovery**: Find user-facing features and map API endpoints
3. **Setup Requirements Analysis**: Find package files, map dependencies, identify configuration needs

### PHASE 1B: SYSTEMATIC FILE ANALYSIS FOR DOCUMENTATION

> **IMPORTANT:** Must do with todo list.

For each file, document in `## Knowledge Graph`:

- Standard fields plus documentation-specific:
- `documentationGaps`: Missing or incomplete documentation
- `complexityLevel`: How difficult to understand (1-10)
- `userFacingFeatures`: Features needing user documentation
- `developerNotes`: Technical details needing developer docs
- `exampleRequirements`: Code examples or usage scenarios needed
- `apiDocumentationNeeds`: API endpoints requiring documentation
- `configurationOptions`: Configuration parameters needing explanation
- `troubleshootingAreas`: Common issues requiring troubleshooting docs

README-specific fields (when analyzing for README documentation):

| Field                | Description                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `readmeRelevance`    | How component should be represented (1-10) |
| `userImpact`         | How component affects end users            |
| `setupRequirements`  | Prerequisites for this component           |
| `configurationNeeds` | Configuration required                     |
| `featureDescription` | User-facing features provided              |
| `exampleUsage`       | Usage examples for README                  |
| `projectContext`     | How it fits into overall project           |

### PHASE 1C: OVERALL ANALYSIS

Write comprehensive summary showing:

- Complete end-to-end workflows discovered
- Documentation gaps identified
- Priority areas for documentation
- Key features and capabilities (README)
- Setup and configuration requirements (README)

---

## PHASE 2: DOCUMENTATION PLAN GENERATION

Generate detailed documentation plan under `## Documentation Plan`:

- Focus on completeness
- Ensure clarity
- Include examples
- Maintain consistency

For README plans, generate a detailed outline covering: Project Overview, Installation, Usage, Configuration, Development guidelines.

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present documentation plan for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION EXECUTION

Once approved, execute the plan using all DOCUMENTATION_SAFEGUARDS.

---

## SUCCESS VALIDATION

Verify documentation is:

- Accurate (matches actual code)
- Complete (covers all public APIs)
- Helpful (includes examples)

README-specific checks:

- [ ] **Accurate**: All instructions work
- [ ] **Comprehensive**: Covers all setup needs
- [ ] **Helpful**: New users can get started
- [ ] **Tested**: Commands verified to work

Document under `## Documentation Validation`.

---

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Accuracy-first approach**: Verify every documented feature with actual code
- **User-focused content**: Organize documentation based on user needs
- **Example-driven documentation**: Include practical examples and usage scenarios
- **Consistency maintenance**: Follow established documentation patterns
- **No assumptions**: Always verify behavior before documenting

### README Guidelines

- **User-first approach**: Organize content for new users; start with what the project does and why; provide clear getting-started path
- **Verified instructions**: Test all setup and installation instructions; include exact commands that work; document version requirements
- **Practical examples**: Include working examples users can follow; show common use cases; provide copy-pasteable code snippets
- **No assumptions**: Don't assume user knowledge; explain acronyms and domain terms; link to prerequisite documentation

**⚠️ MUST ATTENTION READ:** CLAUDE.md for code pattern examples (backend/frontend) when writing code documentation. See `.claude/docs/` for existing documentation structure.

---

## Anti-Hallucination Protocols

### ASSUMPTION_VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT

Before every major operation:

1. "What assumptions am I making about [X]?"
2. "Have I verified this with actual code evidence?"

### EVIDENCE_CHAIN_VALIDATION

Before claiming any relationship:

- "I believe X calls Y because..." → show actual code
- "This follows pattern Z because..." → cite specific examples

### TOOL_EFFICIENCY_PROTOCOL

- Batch multiple Grep searches into single calls with OR patterns
- Use parallel Read operations for related files

### CONTEXT_ANCHOR_SYSTEM

Every 10 operations:

1. Re-read the original task description
2. Verify the current operation aligns with original goals

### Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

  <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.

   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
