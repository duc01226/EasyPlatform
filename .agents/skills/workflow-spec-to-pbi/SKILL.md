## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Convert one or more canonical 8-section Feature Specs into a complete, sprint-ready PBI backlog.

**Canonical input:** `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md` (one tech-free 8-section Feature Spec per capability). There is no separate A-E engineering bundle — code is the technical source of truth.

**Primary outputs:**

- `team-artifacts/pbis/{date}-pbi-{slug}.md` for each generated PBI.
- `team-artifacts/backlog/spec-to-pbi-{date}-backlog.md` with priority order and dependency graph.
- `plans/reports/spec-to-pbi-{date}-{bucket}.md` with coverage matrix and unresolved questions.

**Universal Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic output:** PBI / backlog / report prose stays tech-agnostic per `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3 — no framework/product/language/design-pattern names; source paths and class names appear ONLY in evidence fields (`**Evidence**`, `[Source:]`), frontmatter, and Mermaid.
- **[BLOCKING] Inherit M1-M5 + logical-ID carry:** See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for BLOCKING criteria. Every generated PBI MUST satisfy M1-M5. Carry each requirement's logical ID (`FR-`/`BR-`) from the spec's requirement/rule statements into the PBI as the PRIMARY citation spine, keeping the spec's `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract-anchor evidence as the SECONDARY carrier (KEEP it). Generated acceptance criteria stay tech-agnostic and observable — one valid interpretation, named failure modes, no implementation details.

## When to Use

- User wants to create all PBIs from an existing Feature Spec (or a bucket of them).
- User wants to split a very large Feature Spec into small sprint-ready PBIs.
- User wants a dependency-aware and priority-ranked backlog from `docs/specs/`.
- User wants shared/foundation tasks identified before feature PBIs.

## When Not to Use

- Raw product vision without any Feature Spec -> use `$workflow-product-discovery`.
- One informal idea -> use `$workflow-idea-to-pbi`.
- Spec creation/update only -> use `$workflow-spec-driven-dev`.
- Implementation after PBIs are ready -> use `$workflow-feature` or `$workflow-big-feature`.

## Protocol

### 1. Activate

Run `$start-workflow workflow-spec-to-pbi` with the user's prompt as context.

### 2. Load Spec Context

Locate and read, per target capability:

- `docs/specs/{Bucket}/INDEX.md` — the bucket catalog (which capabilities exist)
- `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md` — the canonical 8-section Feature Spec. Each PBI is decomposed from its sections:
    - §1 Overview / §3 User Stories & Acceptance Criteria → PBI scope + acceptance criteria
    - §4 Business Rules (`BR-`) + §3 (`US-`/`AC-`) → logical-ID citation spine (M3)
    - §5 Domain Model (Mermaid ERD) → entity/aggregate impact for `## Domain Impact`
    - §6 Process Flows → vertical-slice story boundaries
    - §7 Permissions & Roles → access-control acceptance criteria
    - §8 Test Specifications (`TC-`) → expected TC categories per PBI

If the spec path is missing or ambiguous, ask the user for the exact bucket / Feature Spec path before generating PBIs.

### 3. Freshness Gate

Run `$spec-index` in audit mode before PBI generation.

- If stale behavior is found, run/update the impacted spec sections before generating PBIs.
- If only structural/doc formatting is stale, record the risk and continue.
- If critical domain/API/business-rule sections are stale, stop and ask whether to update specs first.

### 4. Coverage Matrix

Create a matrix with one row per independently deliverable item:

| Spec Source      | Capability     | Feature/Operation | Domain Impact             | Shared Dependency | PBI Type                                      | Status  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `{Feature §sec}` | `{capability}` | `{feature}`       | entity/state/event/API/UI | yes/no            | feature/foundation/shared/migration/test-data | planned |

Every source feature/operation must map to exactly one of:

- Generated PBI
- Shared/foundation PBI
- Existing PBI reference
- Explicit out-of-scope decision with reason

### 5. Large Spec Decomposition

Apply these scale rules before creating PBIs:

| Scope                      | Required Breakdown                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 capabilities           | Process inline with one task per capability and feature group         |
| 4-10 capabilities          | Split by capability, then feature/operation group                     |
| 10+ capabilities           | Incremental capability-group batches with coverage matrix checkpoints |
| Any PBI > 8 story points   | Split with SPIDR until each PBI is <= 8 story points                  |
| Cross-cutting prerequisite | Create shared/foundation PBI before dependent feature PBIs            |

### 6. Domain Analysis Gate

Run `$domain-analysis` when any spec item includes:

- New or changed entities, aggregates, value objects, or ownership boundaries
- State machines or lifecycle transitions
- Cross-service event ownership or synchronization
- Data migration or seed/test-data needs

Record domain findings in each affected PBI under `## Domain Impact`.

### 7. PBI Generation Loop

For each matrix row that needs a new PBI:

1. Run `$refine` to create the PBI artifact.
2. Run `$review-artifact --type=pbi`.
3. Run `$story` to create vertical-slice stories.
4. Run `$review-artifact --type=story`.
5. Run `$pbi-challenge`.
6. Run `$dor-gate`.
7. Run `$pbi-mockup` only when UI is involved.

Each PBI MUST include:

- Logical requirement IDs (`FR-`/`BR-`) carried from the spec as the primary citation spine (M3).
- Source spec references with `file:section` evidence (secondary, re-anchorable carrier — KEEP).
- GIVEN/WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria — tech-agnostic and observable (M1/M4).
- Story points and complexity.
- Dependencies table with `must-before`, `can-parallel`, `blocked-by`, or `independent`.
- Priority input data for `$prioritize`.
- Test specification needs, including expected TC categories.
- Domain impact and shared/foundation task references.

### 8. Cross-PBI Prioritization

After all PBI loops finish, run `$prioritize` once across the full generated set.

The backlog artifact MUST include:

- Rank and recommended implementation order.
- Dependency graph and first-do/blocked/defer groups.
- Foundation/shared tasks first when other PBIs depend on them.
- RICE or MoSCoW rationale.
- DoR status per PBI.
- Remaining open questions.

### 8.5 Near-Final Documentation Synchronization

Run `$docs-update` after `$prioritize` and before `$workflow-end`.

Purpose:

- Sync generated PBIs/stories/backlog outputs back into the canonical Feature Specs where applicable.
- Sync Feature Spec §8 Test Specifications with the generated TC needs.
- Verify Feature Specs, derived bucket `INDEX.md`, and TDD/spec docs do not drift after PBI generation.
- Record skipped sub-phases explicitly when no impacted docs exist.

### 9. Completion Criteria

Workflow can close only when:

- Every spec source item is represented in the coverage matrix.
- Every generated PBI has dependency and priority fields.
- Shared/foundation PBIs are explicit and ordered before dependents.
- Domain-analysis findings are attached where domain changes are implied.
- The final backlog artifact ranks all PBIs and explains what to do first.
- `$docs-update` has run as the near-final sync gate, with Feature Specs (§8) and derived bucket indexes either updated or explicitly marked unchanged.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $scout -> $spec-index -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $plan-validate -> $why-review -> $refine -> $why-review -> $review-artifact --type=pbi -> $story -> $why-review -> $review-artifact --type=story -> $pbi-challenge -> $dor-gate -> $pbi-mockup -> $prioritize -> $docs-update -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

<!-- /SYNC:subagent-return-contract -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** use the canonical Feature Specs as input; do not invent unrelated opportunities.
- **MUST** decompose big Feature Specs into small PBIs before story generation.
- **MUST** include dependency, priority, domain impact, and shared-task details.
- **MUST** write artifacts incrementally after each capability/feature.
- **MUST** run `$prioritize` once at the end across all generated PBIs.
- **MUST** run `$docs-update` after `$prioritize` and before `$workflow-end` to keep specs, feature docs, and TDD/spec docs synchronized.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/hooks/lib/prompt-injections.cjs` + `.claude/.ck.json`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
