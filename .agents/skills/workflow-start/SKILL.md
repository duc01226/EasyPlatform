## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Detect user intent → present catalog/custom options → activate with full task tracking plan.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — Match prompt against workflow catalog; identify best catalog workflow + optional custom pipeline
2. **Ask** — Use a direct user question to present up to THREE options before doing anything else
3. **Activate** — Create ALL task tracking items for chosen sequence; mark first `in_progress`

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION **always** call a direct user question before activating — NEVER auto-activate or skip the confirmation step
- Present THREE options: `A) Activate [Workflow] (Recommended)` | `B) Custom Pipeline: [step → ...]` | `C) Execute directly`
- Propose Custom Pipeline when no catalog workflow is a strong fit (>80% steps relevant = use catalog)
- `workflows.json` `workflows` field is an **OBJECT** — use `workflows[workflowId]`, NEVER `.find()` or `[index]`
- Create ALL task tracking items BEFORE marking the first task `in_progress` — batch creation, then execute
- NEVER mark a task `completed` without invoking its skill invocation — skip = `in_progress` + comment, not delete
- ALWAYS check context for `## Workflow Catalog` first (Tier 1) — NEVER read `workflows.json` directly when catalog is in context
- If another workflow is active, it auto-switches (ends current, starts new) — no manual cleanup needed

**NOT for:** Manual step execution (follow task tracking items), workflow design (use `planning`), catalog management.

**Related:** `$workflow-start <workflowId>` | Hook: `workflow-step-tracker.cjs` | Hook: `workflow-router.cjs`

---

## Custom Pipeline Option

When the prompt doesn't cleanly match a single catalog workflow — or combining steps from multiple workflows serves the request better — the AI MAY propose a **Custom Pipeline** alongside the catalog option.

### When to propose

| Condition                                    | Example                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No catalog workflow matches well             | "Review hook changes and update skill docs" — spans review + docs           |
| Best-match has significant unnecessary steps | Quick investigate + fix, but `bugfix` includes full TDD + integration cycle |
| Prompt combines 2+ workflow domains          | "Audit performance and write integration tests for the slow query"          |
| User explicitly requests a step sequence     | "Just run scout, plan, and cook — nothing else"                             |

**Do NOT propose** when a catalog workflow is a strong match (>80% of its steps are relevant). Catalog workflows encode validated best-practice sequences — prefer them.

### How to build

1. **Valid steps only** — Use only keys from `commandMapping` in `workflows.json`. No invented step names.
2. **Logical order** — Investigate → Plan → Implement → Test. Never reverse dependency order.
3. **Minimal** — Include only steps the prompt needs. No "just in case" additions.
4. **Name it** — Short descriptive name: "Quick Fix + Docs", "Audit + Test Coverage".

### How to present (ask the user directly format)

Show full step sequences for ALL options so the user compares scope:

```
Option A — Activate "Bug Fix" workflow (Recommended)
  Steps: $scout → $investigate → $debug-investigate → $plan-hard → $fix → $prove-fix → $test → ...

Option B — Custom Pipeline: "Quick Fix + Docs"
  Steps: $scout → $investigate → $fix → $docs-update
  Rationale: Prompt targets a known location — full TDD cycle is over-engineered here.

Option C — Execute directly without workflow
```

**Rules:**

- Always show full step list per option
- One-sentence AI rationale for the custom pipeline
- Catalog workflow = "(Recommended)" unless custom pipeline confidence is clearly higher
- NEVER present custom pipeline as the only option — always include the catalog option

### Task creation for Custom Pipeline

Same 1:1 protocol — one task tracking per step. Use `[Custom]` prefix to distinguish from catalog tasks:

```
Task tracking: subject="[Custom] /{step-name} — {brief description}", description="Custom pipeline step N/{total}.", activeForm="Executing /{step-name}"
```

---

## Workflow Lookup — Token-Efficient (3-Tier Strategy)

ALWAYS try tiers in order — stop at first success.

### Tier 1: Context (FREE — no file reads)

The workflow catalog is already injected as `## Workflow Catalog` in your context (injected by `workflow-router.cjs` on every UserPromptSubmit).

1. Search your context for `## Workflow Catalog`
2. Find the line: `**{workflowId}** — {name}`
3. Read the NEXT line: `  Use: ... | Steps: /step1 → /step2 → ...`
4. Parse the `Steps:` value — these ARE the slash commands for task tracking

**Example:** `Steps: $scout → $plan-hard → $cook → $test → $workflow-end`
→ Create 5 task tracking items for `$scout`, `$plan-hard`, `$cook`, `$test`, `$workflow-end` in order.

✅ Use Tier 1 for: all standard task tracking creation (no file reads needed)
⚠️ Use Tier 2 if: catalog not in context, OR you need `preActions.injectContext`

### Tier 2: Targeted Grep (1 grep operation)

Use when catalog is absent from context OR `preActions.injectContext` is needed:

```
Grep: pattern='"<workflowId>":'  path='.claude/workflows.json'  context=35
```

Returns only that workflow's entry (~35 lines vs full file).
Parse: `sequence` array → step IDs → resolve via `commandMapping`.

### Tier 3: Minimal Read (last resort — avoid)

Only if Tier 1 and Tier 2 both fail:

```
Read '.claude/workflows.json' lines 1-15    ← commandMapping only
Then Grep '"<workflowId>":' context=30
```

**NEVER** read the full file — it is large and wastes tokens.

---

## After Activation — Task Creation Protocol (ZERO TOLERANCE)

FIRST action after activation: create EXACTLY one task tracking for EACH entry in the workflow's `sequence` array.

### How to read `workflows.json` — CRITICAL SCHEMA

**`workflows.json` is a JSON OBJECT, not an array.** Most common AI mistake.

```
{
  "commandMapping": { <stepId>: { "claude": "/cmd", "copilot": "/cmd" } },
  "settings":       { ... },
  "workflows":      { <workflowId>: WorkflowEntry }   ← OBJECT, keyed by ID
}
```

**Lookup algorithm:**

```
workflow = workflows[workflowId]           // key lookup — NOT .find(), NOT [index]
steps    = workflow.sequence               // array of step ID strings
// resolve slash command:
slashCmd = commandMapping[stepId].claude   // commandMapping["scout"].claude → "$scout"
```

**WorkflowEntry fields:**

| Field                        | Type     | Notes                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `name`                       | string   | Display name                            |
| `confirmFirst`               | boolean  | Prompt user before starting             |
| `sequence`                   | string[] | Ordered step IDs — SOLE source of truth |
| `whenToUse` / `whenNotToUse` | string   | Natural language intent matching        |
| `preActions`                 | object   | Optional `injectContext` / `readFiles`  |

**FORBIDDEN (common mistakes):**

```
// ❌ WRONG
workflows.find(w => w.id === workflowId)
workflows[0]

// ✅ CORRECT
workflows[workflowId]
Object.keys(workflows)   // list all IDs
```

### Task creation steps

1. **Tier 1 first (no file read):** Search context for `## Workflow Catalog` → find `**{workflowId}**` → parse `Steps:` line → slash commands are ready to use
2. **Tier 2 if needed:** `Grep .claude/workflows.json --pattern '"<workflowId>":'  --context 35` → parse `sequence` + `commandMapping`
3. Create one task tracking per step IN ORDER

> See **Workflow Lookup — Token-Efficient (3-Tier Strategy)** above for full lookup rules and fallback chain.

**Task format:**

```
Task tracking: subject="[Workflow] /{step-name} — {brief description}", description="Workflow step N/{total}. {conditional note}", activeForm="Executing /{step-name}"
```

**Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- **1:1 mapping** — each sequence entry = exactly one task. No consolidation, no invented tasks.
- **Conditional steps still get tasks** — add to description: "Conditional — skip if reviews pass"
- **Recursive self-calls get tasks** — e.g., `[Workflow] $workflow-review-changes — Recursive re-review (conditional)`
- **Count verification** — after creation: `task count == len(sequence)`. Fix mismatch before proceeding.

Create ALL tasks first → then `TaskUpdate` first task to `in_progress`.

---

## Step Execution Protocol

Per step: `TaskUpdate in_progress` → **invoke skill invocation** → complete skill → `TaskUpdate completed`.

- Completing a task without invoking its skill invocation = **workflow violation**
- Validation gates (`$plan-validate`, `$plan-review`, `$why-review`) MUST use a direct user question — never auto-approve
- To skip a conditional step: `TaskUpdate in_progress` → comment "Skipped — {reason}" → `TaskUpdate completed`. Never delete.

---

## Workflow-in-Workflow Gate (HARD GATE — NO EXCEPTIONS)

Some workflow steps ARE themselves full workflows. Running them inline causes the parent session to absorb the entire nested workflow's tool calls, file reads, and sub-agent reports — guaranteed context overflow on long sequences.

**Steps requiring sub-agent delegation (hard gate):**

| Step                       | Workflow activated | Steps | Agent type      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ----- | --------------- |
| `$workflow-review-changes` | `review-changes`   | 16    | `code-reviewer` |
| `$workflow-review`         | `review`           | 14    | `code-reviewer` |

**Protocol when these steps appear in the active workflow sequence:**

1. NEVER invoke via inline skill invocation call
2. Spawn via `spawn_agent` tool: `agent_type: "code-reviewer"`
3. Agent prompt must include: current git diff context + feature/task description
4. Sub-agent runs the full nested workflow in its isolated context
5. Return ONLY SYNC:subagent-return-contract summary — write full findings to `plans/reports/`
6. Main agent reads `plans/reports/` file only when resolving specific blockers

> The `workflow-step-tracker.cjs` PostToolUse hook injects the ⚠️ **[WORKFLOW-IN-WORKFLOW GATE]** warning automatically when the next step is one of the above.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
