> Codex compatibility note:
>
> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - User-question prompts mean to ask the user directly in Codex.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, execute each listed child-skill step explicitly and report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:START -->

## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Produce a Keep-a-Changelog entry under `[Unreleased]` by systematically reviewing file changes — telling users, in business terms citing affected logical IDs and flagging breaking changes, what changed and why it matters, NEVER what files/classes were touched.

**Summary:**

- Translate every diff into business impact: name the user-facing capability, never the class/file/enum/migration (the "Business Focus" table is the lens — e.g. "Fixed pipeline loading error", not "Fixed null ref in GetById").
- Drive the review through a throwaway `.ai/workspace/changelog-notes-*.md` notes file (categorize Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security), then DELETE it in the final cleanup step — a leftover notes file is an anti-pattern.
- Always write the entry under `[Unreleased]` (create the section if absent), grouped by module/feature rather than per-file, preserving existing entries.
- Cite affected logical IDs (`FR-`/`BR-`/`TC-`) in `**Refs**` and prefix any breaking change with `**BREAKING:**` plus a one-line migration/impact note; omit the Breaking block when there is none.

**Workflow:**

1. **Gather Changes** — Get changed files via `git diff` (PR, commit, or range mode)
2. **Create Temp Notes** — Build categorized review notes (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)
3. **Review Each File** — Read diffs, identify business impact, categorize changes
4. **Generate Entry** — Write Keep-a-Changelog formatted entry under `[Unreleased]`
5. **Cleanup** — Delete temp notes file

**Key Rules:**

- Use business-focused language, not technical jargon (e.g., "Added pipeline management" not "Added PipelineController.cs")
- Group related changes by module/feature, not by file
- Always insert under the `[Unreleased]` section; create it if missing
- **Cite logical IDs + flag breaking changes (M3/M1):** See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for BLOCKING criteria. Each entry cites the logical IDs it affects (`FR-`/`TC-`, plus `BR-` where relevant) and a business-level change description; keep implementation jargon and class/file names out of entry prose per `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3. Explicitly flag any breaking change with a `**BREAKING:**` prefix and a one-line migration/impact note.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Changelog Skill

Generate business-focused changelog entries by systematically reviewing file changes — name the user-facing capability, NEVER the class/file.

## Pre-Execution Checklist

1. **Find existing CHANGELOG.md location**
    - Check root: `./CHANGELOG.md` (preferred)
    - Fallback: `./docs/CHANGELOG.md`
    - Not found: create at root

2. **Read current changelog** — understand format + last entries

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Changes

Determine change scope by mode:

```bash
# PR/Branch-based (default)
git diff origin/develop...HEAD --name-only

# Commit-based
git show {commit} --name-only

# Range-based
git diff {from}..{to} --name-only
```

### Step 2: Create Temp Notes File

Create `.ai/workspace/changelog-notes-{YYMMDD-HHMM}.md`:

```markdown
# Changelog Review Notes - {date}

## Files Changed

- [ ] file1.ts -
- [ ] file2.cs -

## Categories

### Added (new features)

-

### Changed (modifications to existing)

-

### Fixed (bug fixes)

-

### Deprecated

-

### Removed

-

### Security

-

## Business Summary

<!-- What does this mean for users? -->
```

### Step 3: Systematic File Review

For each changed file:

1. Read file or diff
2. Identify **business impact** (not just technical change)
3. Check box, note in temp file
4. Categorize into appropriate section

**Business Focus Guidelines**:

| Technical (Avoid)                  | Business-Focused (Use)                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Added `StageCategory` enum         | Added stage categories for pipeline tracking |
| Created `PipelineController` class | Added API endpoints for pipeline management  |
| Fixed null reference in GetById    | Fixed pipeline loading error                 |
| Added migration file               | Database schema updated for new features     |

### Step 4: Holistic Review

Read temp notes file completely. Ask:

- Main feature/fix?
- Who benefits, how?
- What can users now do they couldn't before?

### Step 5: Generate Changelog Entry

Format (Keep a Changelog):

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### {Module}: {Feature Title}

**Feature/Fix**: {One-line business description}
**Refs**: {FR-/BR-/TC- logical IDs affected}

#### Added

- {Business-focused item}

#### Changed

- {What behavior changed}

#### Fixed

- {What issue was resolved}

#### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** {what changed} — {migration/impact note}
```

> If no breaking change: omit the `#### Breaking` block. Cite logical IDs in `**Refs**`; keep class/file names out of all entry prose.

### Step 6: Update Changelog

1. Read existing CHANGELOG.md
2. Insert new entry under `[Unreleased]` section
3. No `[Unreleased]` section → create it after header
4. Preserve existing entries

### Step 7: Cleanup

Delete temp notes file: `.ai/workspace/changelog-notes-*.md`

## Grouping Strategy

Group related changes by module/feature:

```markdown
### Your Service: Order Pipeline Management

**Feature**: Customizable order pipeline/stage management.

#### Added

**Backend**:

- Entities: Pipeline, Stage, PipelineStage
- Controllers: PipelineController, StageController
- Commands: SavePipelineCommand, DeletePipelineCommand

**Frontend**:

- Pages: order-pipeline-page
- Components: pipeline-filter, pipeline-stage-display
```

## Anti-Patterns

1. ❌ Creating new changelog in docs/ when root exists
2. ❌ Skipping file review (leads to missed changes)
3. ❌ Technical jargon without business context
4. ❌ Forgetting to delete temp notes file
5. ❌ Not using [Unreleased] section
6. ❌ Listing every file instead of grouping by feature

## Examples

### Good Entry

```markdown
### Your Service: Order Pipeline Management

**Feature**: Customizable order pipeline/stage management for fulfillment workflows.

#### Added

- Drag-and-drop pipeline stage builder with default templates
- Stage categories (Created, Confirmed, Packed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)
- Pipeline duplication for quick setup
- Multi-language stage names (EN/VI)

#### Changed

- Order cards now show current pipeline stage
- Order creation wizard includes pipeline selection
```

### Bad Entry (Too Technical)

```markdown
### Pipeline Changes

#### Added

- Pipeline.cs entity
- StageCategory enum
- PipelineController
- SavePipelineCommand
- 20251216000000_MigrateDefaultStages migration
```

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-feature` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → plan → feature-implement → review → changelog
> 2. **Execute `$changelog` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"$test (Recommended)"** — Run tests after changelog update
- **"$docs-update"** — Update docs if needed
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc. If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, required docs checked/read or setup route completed, `lessons.md` confirmed, citation emitted.

<!-- /SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source work, read required project-reference docs and cite `Reference docs read: ...`.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:START -->

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce a Keep-a-Changelog entry under `[Unreleased]` that tells users — in business terms, citing affected logical IDs and flagging breaking changes — what changed and why it matters, NEVER what files/classes were touched.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Project Reference Docs:** Read required project-reference docs (always `lessons.md`) before target work.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use business-focused language, group by module/feature — name the user-facing capability, NEVER the class/file/enum/migration — why: changelog readers track impact, not implementation (see Business Focus table).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `FR-`/`BR-`/`TC-` logical IDs in `**Refs**`; prefix every breaking change with `**BREAKING:**` + one-line migration/impact note; omit the Breaking block when none — why: readers need traceability and a migration signal, not noise.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** always insert under `[Unreleased]` (create it if absent), preserve existing entries; DELETE the temp `.ai/workspace/changelog-notes-*.md` notes file in cleanup — why: a leftover notes file is an anti-pattern and entries belong only under Unreleased.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** drive the review through the throwaway notes file: review EVERY changed file, categorize Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security — why: skipping file review silently drops changes.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** verify each business-impact claim against the actual diff (`file:line`), confidence >80% to act, <80% re-read the diff first — NEVER speculate impact from a filename — why: a misread diff ships a wrong user-facing claim.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** find the existing `CHANGELOG.md` before writing — root `./CHANGELOG.md` preferred, fallback `./docs/CHANGELOG.md` — NEVER create a new changelog in `docs/` when root exists — why: a split changelog fragments release history.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos BEFORE starting (one per file read), keep one `in_progress`, mark `completed` immediately, add a final review todo — why: long diffs exhaust context and lose findings.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate route/skip decisions with the user via a direct user question — never auto-decide a workflow is "too simple to need".

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                   | Rebuttal                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Diff is small, skip the notes file"      | Still categorize each file — uncategorized changes get silently dropped.               |
| "Filename says it all, skip the diff"     | Read the diff: a filename names the file, not the business impact. Show `file:line`.   |
| "Just list the files changed"             | Group by module/feature in business terms — file lists are the bad-entry anti-pattern. |
| "No existing CHANGELOG, make one in docs" | Search root first; only create at root when truly absent.                              |
| "Notes file is harmless, leave it"        | Delete it in cleanup — a leftover notes file is an anti-pattern.                       |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal echo:** business-language Keep-a-Changelog entry under `[Unreleased]`, logical IDs cited, breaking changes flagged, NEVER file/class names — temp notes file deleted.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** group by feature in business terms, cite logical IDs, flag `**BREAKING:**` — why: impact over implementation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos before starting and delete the temp notes file in cleanup.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

<!-- CODEX:SYNC-PROMPT-PROTOCOLS:START -->

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## Shared AI-SDD Protocol Markers

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, TC/test, source evidence, and docs/spec update.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

> **Active reference:** `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` in the active skills root.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
  **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
