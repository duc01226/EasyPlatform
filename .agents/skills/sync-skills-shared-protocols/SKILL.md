## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Two operations — (A) propagate updated content for existing SYNC: blocks across all skills, or (B) add a new SYNC: block to all skill/agent files that don't have it yet.

> **Renamed:** formerly `/sync-protocols` — that name no longer resolves as a slash command; use `$sync-skills-shared-protocols`.

**Canonical source:** `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md`

## Workflow

### Operation A: Update Existing Block Content

Use when a SYNC: block already exists in files and push updated content to all of them.

### Step 1: Identify What Changed

If user specifies a tag name (e.g., `sync-skills-shared-protocols understand-code-first`):

- Sync only that tag

If no tag specified:

- Read `sync-inline-versions.md`
- Ask user which tag(s) to sync, or "all"

### Step 2: Read Canonical Content

For each tag to sync:

1. Read `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md`
2. Extract content under `## SYNC:{tag-name}` heading (everything between that heading and the next `---` or `## SYNC:`)

### Step 3: Find All Skills with Tag

```bash
grep -rl "SYNC:{tag-name}" .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Step 4: Replace Content in Each Skill

For each file found:

1. Find `<!-- SYNC:{tag-name} -->` open tag
2. Find `<!-- /SYNC:{tag-name} -->` close tag
3. Replace everything between them with the canonical content
4. Do NOT touch `:reminder` blocks — those are separate, shorter versions

### Step 5: Verify

Run these checks after all replacements:

```python
# 1. SYNC tag balance (all opens have matching closes)
# 2. Content matches canonical source
# 3. No content outside SYNC blocks was modified
```

Report:

- Tags synced
- Files updated (count)
- Any balance issues

### Step 6: Reminder Blocks

`:reminder` blocks (`<!-- SYNC:{tag}:reminder -->`) are 1-line summaries at the bottom of skills for AI recency attention. These are NOT auto-synced — they are hand-written. Skip them unless user explicitly asks to update reminders too.

---

### Operation B: Add a New Block to All Files

Use when a NEW SYNC: block needs to be inserted into all 183 skill/agent files that don't have it yet. This is a bulk-insert operation — not a content-update.

**When to use:** A new protocol rule is added to `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` and should appear in static carriers (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Codex, skills, and agents).

#### Step B1: Add block content to canonical source

Edit `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` and add a new section:

```markdown
## SYNC:{new-block-name}

> **[Rule content here]**

---
```

#### Step B2: Add block to `sync-hooks-to-skills.py`

Edit `.claude/scripts/sync-hooks-to-skills.py`:

1. Add entry to `BLOCKS` dict:

```python
BLOCKS = {
    # ... existing blocks ...
    "new-block-name": """\
<!-- SYNC:new-block-name -->

> **[Full block content here — exactly as it should appear in files]**

<!-- /SYNC:new-block-name -->""",
}
```

2. Add 1-line reminder to `REMINDERS` dict:

```python
REMINDERS = {
# ... existing reminders ...
"new-block-name": """\

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

<!-- SYNC:new-block-name:reminder -->
**MUST ATTENTION** [one-line summary of the rule].
<!-- /SYNC:new-block-name:reminder -->""",
}
```

3. Add the block name to the relevant tier list(s) (controls which targets receive it + insertion order):

```python
# Skills keep the original 2-block set — do NOT add agent-only rules here.
SKILL_BLOCK_ORDER = ["critical-thinking-mindset", "ai-mistake-prevention"]

# Core-6: every agent (skills/SKILL.md is unaffected).
CORE_BLOCK_ORDER = ["critical-thinking-mindset", "ai-mistake-prevention",
                    "sequential-thinking-protocol", "task-tracking-external-report",
                    "project-reference-docs-guide", "agent-bootstrap"]

# Code-10: Core-6 + code-investigation blocks, for agents that read/review AND fix code.
CODE_BLOCK_ORDER = CORE_BLOCK_ORDER + ["understand-code-first", "evidence-based-reasoning",
                                       "cross-service-check", "fix-layer-accountability"]

# Readonly-Code-8: Core-6 + reading-discipline blocks only, for read-only/design
# agents that locate/read/design code but never fix a layer or cross a service
# boundary (excludes the two mutation-oriented blocks).
READONLY_CODE_BLOCK_ORDER = CORE_BLOCK_ORDER + ["understand-code-first", "evidence-based-reasoning"]
```

**Agent tiering:** agents no longer share one block list. `find_target_files()` classifies each `.claude/agents/*.md` by explicit membership in one of three sets:

- `CODE_AGENTS` (17 code/review/fix agents → `CODE_BLOCK_ORDER`, Code-10).
- `READONLY_CODE_AGENTS` (4 read-only/design agents — `researcher`, `scout`, `scout-external`, `ui-ux-designer` → `READONLY_CODE_BLOCK_ORDER`, Core-6 + understand-code-first + evidence-based-reasoning; the mutation-oriented `cross-service-check` + `fix-layer-accountability` are deliberately excluded to save tokens on agents that only locate/read/design code).
- `CORE_ONLY_AGENTS` (8 non-code agents → `CORE_BLOCK_ORDER`, Core-6).

An agent in **none of the three sets (or in more than one)** raises `SystemExit` — no silent default; classify it before the script will run. Skills always use `SKILL_BLOCK_ORDER`. Pass `--agents-only` to scope a run to agents (skip skills).

> **Adding a new agent:** add its basename to exactly one of `CODE_AGENTS` / `READONLY_CODE_AGENTS` / `CORE_ONLY_AGENTS` in `sync-hooks-to-skills.py` **and** in the regression suite `.claude/hooks/tests/suites/agent-universal-rules.test.cjs` (TC-UAR-005 fails until both agree). The two enforce one invariant.
>
> **Note — the inserter is insert-only.** Moving an agent from CODE to READONLY_CODE (or otherwise dropping a block from its tier) does NOT remove the now-excess SYNC block from its `.md` on disk — `process_file` only inserts missing blocks. Strip the excess block(s) from the agent `.md` source by hand (or a scoped one-off) so the regression suite's tier assertions pass.

#### Step B3: Run the script (dry-run first)

```bash
python .claude/scripts/sync-hooks-to-skills.py --dry-run --verbose
# Verify: expected N updated, 0 errors

python .claude/scripts/sync-hooks-to-skills.py --verbose
# Verify: 183 updated (or close — some may already have it → skip)
```

#### Step B4: Verify

```bash
# Confirm target files now contain the new block. Expected count is TIER-AWARE:
#   - block in SKILL_BLOCK_ORDER          → all skills + all agents
#   - block in CORE_BLOCK_ORDER           → all 29 agents (skills excluded)
#   - block in READONLY_CODE_BLOCK_ORDER  → 21 agents (17 code + 4 readonly-code)
#   - block in CODE_BLOCK_ORDER           → 17 code agents only
grep -rl "SYNC:new-block-name" .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l

# Then run the agent-coverage regression suite — it asserts tier membership,
# disjointness, and SYNC tag balance across all 29 agents.
node .claude/hooks/tests/run-all-tests.cjs --filter=agent-universal
```

Check a representative file of each affected tier manually to confirm placement and formatting.

## Usage Examples

```
$sync-skills-shared-protocols understand-code-first     # Sync one tag (Operation A)
$sync-skills-shared-protocols all                        # Sync all tags (Operation A)
$sync-skills-shared-protocols                            # Interactive — asks which tags
# Adding new block: use Operation B workflow above (script-driven)
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS edit `sync-inline-versions.md` FIRST, then run this skill
- NEVER modify content outside `<!-- SYNC:tag -->` boundaries
- NEVER touch `:reminder` blocks unless explicitly asked
- If close tag is missing in a target file, SKIP that file and report it as an error
- Use the `Grep` tool (not shell grep) per project conventions
- Verify tag balance after every sync run
- For bulk-insert (Operation B): use `sync-hooks-to-skills.py` — NEVER do it manually across 288 files

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** edit `sync-inline-versions.md` FIRST before syncing to skills
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** verify SYNC tag balance after every sync run
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify content outside `<!-- SYNC:tag -->` boundaries
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** skip files with missing close tags and report as errors

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
  **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
