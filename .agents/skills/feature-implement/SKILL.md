## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — implemented with deep research, comprehensive planning, and maximum quality verification (planned, reviewed, tested, documented) — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**Workflow:**

1. **Research** — Deep investigation, multiple researcher subagents
2. **Plan** — Detailed plan via `$plan`; user approval required
3. **Implement** — Execute with full code review + SRE review
4. **Verify** — Run all tests, review changes, update docs

**Key Rules:**

- Maximum thoroughness: research → plan → implement → review → test → docs
- User approval required at plan stage
- Break work into todo tasks; add final self-review task

> **Renamed:** formerly `cook` — now `$feature-implement`. The old name no longer resolves as a slash command.

> **feature-implement vs plan-execute:** `feature-implement` takes an idea/feature description and goes idea → research → **plan (created here)** → shipped. Use `$plan-execute` instead when a plan file already exists and you only need disciplined phase-by-phase execution + commit. feature-implement owns the front of the pipeline (research + planning); plan-execute owns the back (phase gates + auto-commit + `--parallel`/`--approval`/`--tests` flags).

## Standalone Mode Pipeline (skip entirely if invoked inside a workflow)

> **MANDATORY — standalone `$feature-implement` only.** When invoked OUTSIDE a workflow, wrap the core spine in this quality loop. Detect an active workflow via the current task list FIRST: if a parent `[Workflow]` row exists, SKIP this section — the surrounding workflow already sequences plan/review/why-review around this skill (e.g. `workflow-feature` wraps feature-implement with exactly these steps).
>
> Create these as task tracking tasks up front, in order, then execute them:
>
> 1. **`$spec` — spec-driven, BEFORE any plan or code.** Create or update the tech-free 8-section Feature Spec under `docs/specs/` so the plan and implementation satisfy an agreed contract, not chat memory. Decide the case from evidence: net-new capability with no code yet → `$spec [mode=draft]` (provisional, `Evidence: TBD`); enhancement to an already-documented feature → `$spec [mode=update]`; behavior/contract change to existing spec → `$spec [mode=amend]`; buggy/undocumented area that now warrants a spec → `$spec [mode=init]`. If a governing spec already exists and fully covers this change, record `Spec verified current — no change` with `file:line` evidence and proceed. **Skip ONLY in fast mode** (ALL Default Mode Policy trivial-task conditions met — no behavior/contract change); record the skip reason. Decide the case explicitly — skip only the authoring, never the decision.
> 2. **`$plan`** — author the implementation plan from the spec. feature-implement's Comprehensive Planning phase (Step 2) satisfies this; emit a reviewable plan artifact under `plans/`. Map each plan phase's `## Test Specifications` to the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` IDs.
> 3. **`$plan-review`** — recursively review/validate the plan; fix validated findings before implementing.
> 4. **Proceed** — execute the core implementation spine (research already done → implement → test → review → docs).
> 5. **`$spec [mode=sync]`** — _spec-driven closure._ Reconcile the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` ↔ integration tests and refresh `Evidence: TBD` markers to real `file:line` now that code exists. Run `$spec [mode=tests]` first if the implementation introduced behavior not yet captured as a test case. Skip only when step 1 was skipped (fast-mode trivial, no spec touched).
> 6. **`$review-changes`** — review the diff before commit.
> 7. **`$why-review`** — review rationale and change quality of the implementation.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, refactor, test, or abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" raising change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- Simpler design easy to change beats sophisticated design that isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD (full rigor).** Every section below — deep research, mandatory `$plan`, full `code-reviewer` review, mandatory tests, mandatory `$docs-update` — applies by default.
>
> **Opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL true** (task genuinely trivial):
>
> - Single-file edit, ≤30 lines changed
> - No design choice (only one reasonable approach)
> - No cross-service impact, no contract change, no new dependency
> - No new pattern — follows existing codebase pattern
> - Existing tests cover change OR change non-functional (typo, comment, log message)
>
> **Any condition fails → use full protocol below.** When in doubt, default hard. Skipping review/tests on non-trivial change ships bugs.
>
> **Fast mode skips (and only skips):** researcher subagent phase (direct grep instead), mandatory `code-reviewer` review (self-review only), separate test phase (verify inline). Does NOT skip `$plan` step, test execution, `$docs-update` triage.

### Backend Context (if applicable)

> When task involves backend changes, read these directly before implementing:

- CQRS commands/queries, validation, repositories, entity events: `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`
- Entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync: `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md`
- **Repository type (service-specific):** when the project declares a per-service repository abstraction (`backendServices.serviceRepositories` in `docs/project-config.json`), use that repository type for the service — NEVER the generic root repository base.

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When task involves frontend or UI changes:

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

**Ultrathink** plan and implement these tasks with maximum verification:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.**

<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**Mode:** Extra research, detailed planning, mandatory reviews.

## Workflow

### 0. Goal Contract Read (BEFORE implementation)

- Resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop`: active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the current request via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`.
- Read the saved success criteria BEFORE any code change — implementation serves the saved criteria, not chat memory.
- After implementation and verification, append an Iteration Log entry to the goal file: result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output), remaining gaps mapped to criteria.

### 1. Deep Research Phase

- Launch 2-3 `researcher` subagents in parallel covering:
    - Technical approach validation
    - Edge cases, failure modes
    - Security implications
    - Performance considerations
- Use `$scout --ext` for comprehensive codebase analysis
- Research reports max 150 lines each
- **External Memory:** Write all research to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning.
- **Pre-Implementation Trace Gate:** For bugfix, failed verification, stale/incorrect final output, regression, or behavior-changing fix plans, MUST ATTENTION confirm the plan/referenced analysis includes `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and produce the missing-trace list before editing.

> After implementing, run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <file> --json` on modified files; verify no related files need updates.

### Graph-Trace Before Implementation

When graph DB available, BEFORE writing code, trace blast radius:

- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` — what calls this code AND what it triggers
- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction downstream --json` — all downstream consumers
- Prevents breaking implicit dependencies (bus message consumers, event handlers)

### 2. Comprehensive Planning

- Use `planner` subagent with all research reports
- Create full plan directory:
    - `plan.md` — overview with risk assessment
    - `phase-XX-*.md` — detailed phase files
    - Success criteria per phase
    - Rollback strategy

### 3. Verified Implementation

- Implement one phase at a time
- After each phase:
    - Run type-check, compile
    - Run relevant tests
    - Self-review before proceeding

### Batch Checkpoint (Large Plans)

For plans with 10+ tasks, execute in batches with human review:

1. **Execute batch** — Complete next 3 tasks (or user-specified size)
2. **Report** — Show implementation, verification output, any concerns
3. **Wait** — Say "Ready for feedback" and STOP. Do NOT continue automatically.
4. **Apply feedback** — Incorporate changes, execute next batch
5. **Repeat** until all tasks complete

<HARD-GATE>
Plans with 10+ tasks — do NOT execute all tasks continuously without checkpoint.
Stop after every batch for human review. Prevents runaway execution where early
mistakes compound through later tasks.
</HARD-GATE>

### 4. Mandatory Testing

- Use `tester` subagent for full test coverage
- Write tests for:
    - Happy path scenarios
    - Edge cases from research
    - Error handling paths
- NO mocks or fake data
- Repeat until all tests pass

### 5. Mandatory Code Review

- Use `code-reviewer` subagent
- Address all critical and major findings
- Re-run tests after fixes
- Repeat until approved

### 6. Documentation Update

- Use `docs-manager` to update relevant docs
- Use `project-manager` to update project status
- Record architectural decisions

### 7. Final Report

- Summary of all changes
- Test coverage metrics
- Security considerations addressed
- Unresolved questions (if any)
- Ask user to review and approve

## When to Use

- Critical production features
- Security-sensitive changes
- Public API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Cross-service integrations

## Quality Gates

| Gate     | Criteria                  |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Research | 2+ researcher reports     |
| Planning | Full plan directory       |
| Tests    | All pass, no mocks        |
| Review   | 0 critical/major findings |
| Docs     | Updated if needed         |

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via a direct user question. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious" — user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Detect best workflow to continue from here (feature implemented). Ensures review, testing, docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$code-simplifier"** — Simplify and clean up implementation
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — workflow handles sequencing.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)
- `docs/specs/` — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs; generate/update via `$spec [mode=tests]` after implementation)

>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.

> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.

Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- /SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — research-backed, planned, reviewed, tested, documented — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each line is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** Trace observed output backward through every feeder path before fixing.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** When source behavior changes, reconcile affected tests from evidence.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **UI System Context:** Read frontend, SCSS, and design-system docs before any UI change.
- **Graph-Assisted Investigation:** Run a graph command on key files when graph.db exists.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phase tasks and link the parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project-reference docs (always `lessons.md`) before target work.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking; persist plan/review findings incrementally to disk.
- **Critical Thinking Mindset:** Critical + sequential thinking; every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** Add `## Test Specifications` with TC IDs to every plan phase.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD — opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL trivial-task conditions met
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks via task tracking BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via a direct user question — never auto-decide
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip `code-reviewer` review or test execution on non-trivial change

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks via task tracking.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, TC/test, source evidence, and docs/spec update.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
  **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
