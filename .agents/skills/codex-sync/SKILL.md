> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - User-question prompts mean to ask the user directly in Codex.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, execute each listed child-skill step explicitly and report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.

## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Run full Codex mirror sync standalone — equivalent to `npm run codex:sync` without `package.json` or `npm`.

Also bootstraps team-wide Codex completion notifications by copying the portable `.claude/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs` helper into `.codex/scripts/codex/` and upserting notification plus TUI status-line keys into `.codex/config.toml`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Run** — `node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs`
2. **Verify** — Exit code `0` = pass; check stdout summary
3. **Inspect** — On failure, re-run failing stage manually with `--only=<stage>` and `--verbose`

**Key Rules:**

- MUST run all 8 stages in order — orchestrator fails fast on first non-zero exit
- NEVER edit `.agents/skills/codex-sync/**` (auto-mirror) — edit `.claude/skills/codex-sync/**` source instead
- `.claude` is the source for skills/workflows/hooks; generated acceptance targets are `.agents/skills/**`, `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md`, and `AGENTS.md`
- Stages 1-3 mutate `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`; stages 4-8 are read-only verifiers
- Stage 1 upserts `[tui].status_line` to show model+reasoning, current directory, project root, context used, five-hour limit, and weekly limit by default
- Stage 3 mirrors full `CLAUDE.md` into `AGENTS.md`, then appends the generated Codex hook/context mirror and shared AI-SDD markers so Codex has both source instructions and hookless parity context
- Stage 1 must not inline `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` content into `.agents/skills/**`; generated skill mirrors reference the project-reference loading gate instead
- The `SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract` marker must appear after sync in `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- No npm dependency — pure `node` + spawned subprocesses
- Idempotent — safe to re-run; second run produces only timestamp diffs

## Stages

8 stages, sequential, matching `npm run codex:sync`:

| #   | Stage    | Script                                                       | Effect                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | migrate  | `.claude/scripts/codex/migrate-claude-to-codex.mjs`          | Migrate Claude agents → `.codex/agents/`; mirror skills → `.agents/skills/`; setup Codex notifications |
| 2   | hooks    | `.claude/scripts/codex/sync-hooks.mjs`                       | Generate `.codex/hooks.json` + sync report                                                             |
| 3   | context  | `.claude/scripts/codex/sync-context-workflows.mjs`           | Regenerate `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md` + `AGENTS.md` with workflow context and shared AI-SDD markers     |
| 4   | tests    | `node --test .claude/scripts/codex/tests/*.test.mjs`         | Run codex tooling unit tests                                                                           |
| 5   | wf-cycle | `.claude/scripts/codex/verify-workflow-cycle-compliance.mjs` | Verify workflow sequence cycle compliance                                                              |
| 6   | sk-proto | `.claude/scripts/codex/verify-skill-protocol-compliance.mjs` | Verify skill strict-execution-contract                                                                 |
| 7   | residue  | `.claude/scripts/codex/verify-no-project-residue.mjs`        | Verify no project residue in generated and generic source artifacts                                    |
| 8   | sdd      | `.claude/scripts/codex/verify-sdd-semantic-compliance.mjs`   | Verify AI-SDD semantic contract coverage                                                               |

## Usage

```bash
# Full sync (standalone, no npm):
node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs

# Stream live child output:
node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --verbose

# Full sync while forcing skill copy mode:
node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --copy-skills

# Read-only verifiers (no mutation):
node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --only=tests,wf-cycle,sk-proto,residue,sdd

# Skip stages while debugging:
node .claude/skills/codex-sync/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --skip=migrate,hooks
```

**Exit codes:** `0` all pass · `1` orchestrator failure · non-zero propagates from failing stage.

## Closing Reminders

**MUST ATTENTION** invoke ONLY when user explicitly requests codex sync — never auto-invoke
**MUST ATTENTION** edit source `.claude/skills/codex-sync/**`, NEVER the `.agents/skills/codex-sync/**` mirror
**MUST ATTENTION** keep `.codex/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs` generated from `.claude/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs`; edit the `.claude` source first
**MUST ATTENTION** keep Codex config upserts surgical; preserve unrelated `.codex/config.toml` keys and tables while updating the managed notification/status-line keys
**MUST ATTENTION** keep `AGENTS.md` sync comprehensive; mirror full `CLAUDE.md` plus generated hook/context blocks, and preserve unmanaged `AGENTS.md` preface text
**MUST ATTENTION** keep learned-lessons content out of `.agents/skills/**`; skills may point to `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` but must not embed its entries
**MUST ATTENTION** orchestrator fails fast — re-run single failing stage with `--only=<id> --verbose` to debug
**MUST ATTENTION** working directory auto-resolves to repo root from script path — do not pass `--cwd`
**MUST ATTENTION** stages 1-3 mutate; stages 4-8 verify only — use `--only=` for non-destructive validation

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                  | Rebuttal                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Just edit the .agents mirror directly"  | Next sync overwrites it. Always edit `.claude/skills/codex-sync/` source     |
| "Skip a stage to save time"              | Verifiers (4-8) catch drift; skipping = silent regression risk               |
| "Auto-invoke since user mentioned codex" | `disable-model-invocation: true` is binding. Wait for explicit `$codex-sync` |
| "Sync looks idempotent, skip verify"     | Timestamp diffs are normal; structural diffs = bug. Always run verifiers     |

> **[USER-INVOKED ONLY]** Manually triggered via `$codex-sync`. Claude MUST NOT auto-invoke — `disable-model-invocation: true` enforces this.
> **[FAILS FAST]** First non-zero stage exit aborts chain. Re-run failing stage manually to debug.
> **[REPO ROOT]** Orchestrator auto-resolves repo root from its own path. NEVER pass `--cwd`.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/hooks/lib/prompt-injections.cjs` + `.claude/.ck.json`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure unless the user explicitly invoked a workflow/skill and the local protocol treats explicit invocation as confirmation:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
