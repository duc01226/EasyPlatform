<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:START -->

## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first -->

- `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` (Codex has no hook injection — open this file directly before proceeding)
- `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — Styling/BEM guide (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — Design system tokens (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Execute an existing implementation plan phase-by-phase with testing, code review, and user approval gates.

**Workflow:**

1. **Plan Detection** — Find latest plan or use provided path, select next incomplete phase
2. **Analysis & Tasks** — Extract tasks from phase file into task tracking
3. **Implementation** — Implement step-by-step, run type checks
4. **Testing** — Call tester subagent; must reach 100% pass before proceeding
5. **Code Review** — Call code-reviewer subagent; must reach 0 critical issues
6. **User Approval** — BLOCKING gate: wait for explicit user approval
7. **Finalize** — Update status, docs, and auto-commit

**Key Rules:**

- Tests must be 100% passing (Step 3 gate)
- Critical issues must be 0 (Step 4 gate)
- User must explicitly approve before finalize (Step 5 gate)
- One plan phase per command run

**MUST ATTENTION READ** `CLAUDE.md` then **THINK HARDER** to start working on the following plan:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

<plan>$ARGUMENTS<$plan-hard>

---

## Pre-Implementation Granularity Gate (MANDATORY)

<HARD-GATE>

<!-- SYNC:plan-granularity -->

> **Plan Granularity** — Every phase must pass 5-point check before implementation:
>
> 1. Lists exact file paths to modify (not generic "implement X")
> 2. No planning verbs (research, investigate, analyze, determine, figure out)
> 3. Steps ≤30min each, phase total ≤3h
> 4. ≤5 files per phase
> 5. No open decisions or TBDs in approach
>
> **Failing phases →** create sub-plan. Repeat until ALL leaf phases pass (max depth: 3).
> **Self-question:** "Can I start coding RIGHT NOW? If any step needs 'figuring out' → sub-plan it."

<!-- /SYNC:plan-granularity -->

If ANY check fails → STOP. Ask user: "Phase needs more detail before implementation. Refine with $plan-hard? [Y/n]"
DO NOT implement a phase that contains planning verbs, unnamed files, or unresolved decisions.
</HARD-GATE>

---

## Step 0: Plan Detection & Phase Selection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:**

1. Find latest `plan.md` in `./plans`
2. Parse plan for phases and status, auto-select next incomplete (prefer IN_PROGRESS or earliest Planned)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:** Use that plan and detect which phase to work on.

**Output:** `✓ Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]`

---

## Workflow Sequence

**Rules:** Follow steps 1-6 in order. Each step requires output marker `✓ Step N:`. Mark each complete in task tracking before proceeding. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Analysis & Task Extraction

Read plan file completely. Map dependencies. List ambiguities. Identify required skills and activate from catalog. If the plan references analysis files in `.ai/workspace/analysis/`, re-read them before implementation.

**task tracking Initialization:**

- Initialize task tracking with `Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]` and all steps (1-6)
- Read phase file, look for tasks/steps/phases/sections/numbered/bulleted lists
- Convert to task tracking tasks with UNIQUE names:
    - Phase Implementation tasks → Step 2.X (Step 2.1, Step 2.2, etc.)
    - Phase Testing tasks → Step 3.X
    - Phase Code Review tasks → Step 4.X

**Output:** `✓ Step 1: Found [N] tasks across [M] phases - Ambiguities: [list or "none"]`

---

## Step 2: Implementation

Implement selected plan phase step-by-step following extracted tasks. Mark tasks complete as done. For UI work, call `ui-ux-designer` subagent. Run type checking and compile to verify.

**Output:** `✓ Step 2: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete, compilation passed`

---

## Step 3: Testing

Call `tester` subagent. If ANY tests fail: STOP, call `debugger` subagent, fix, re-run. Repeat until 100% pass.

**Testing standards:** Unit tests may use mocks. Integration tests use test environment. Forbidden: commenting out tests, changing assertions to pass, TODO/FIXME to defer fixes.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3: Tests [X/X passed] - All requirements met`

**Validation:** If X ≠ total, Step 3 INCOMPLETE - do not proceed.

---

## Step 4: Code Review

Call `code-reviewer` subagent. If critical issues found: STOP, fix, re-run `tester`, re-run `code-reviewer`. Repeat until no critical issues.

**Output:** `✓ Step 4: Code reviewed - [0] critical issues`

**Validation:** If critical issues > 0, Step 4 INCOMPLETE - do not proceed.

---

## Step 5: User Approval ⏸ BLOCKING GATE

Present summary (3-5 bullets): what implemented, tests passed, code review outcome.

**Ask user explicitly:** "Phase implementation complete. All tests pass, code reviewed. Approve changes?"

**Stop and wait** - do not proceed until user responds.

**Output:** `✓ Step 5: User approved - Ready to complete`

---

## Step 6: Finalize

**Prerequisites:** User approved in Step 5.

1. **STATUS UPDATE (PARALLEL):**
    - Call `project-manager` subagent to update plan status
    - Call `docs-manager` subagent to update documentation

2. **ONBOARDING CHECK:** Detect onboarding requirements + generate summary.

3. **AUTO-COMMIT:** Call `git-manager` subagent. Run only if Steps 1-2 successful + User approved + Tests passed.

**Output:** `✓ Step 6: Finalize - Status updated - Git committed`

---

## Critical Enforcement Rules

**Step output format:** `✓ Step [N]: [Brief status] - [Key metrics]`

**task tracking tracking required:** Initialize at Step 0, mark each step complete before next.

**Mandatory subagent calls:** Step 3: `tester` | Step 4: `code-reviewer` | Step 6: `project-manager` AND `docs-manager` AND `git-manager`

**Blocking gates:**

- Step 3: Tests must be 100% passing
- Step 4: Critical issues must be 0
- Step 5: User must explicitly approve

Do not skip steps. Do not proceed if validation fails. Do not assume approval without user response. One plan phase per command run.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `refactor` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → plan → code → review → sre-review → test → docs
> 2. **Execute `$code` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via a direct user question. Skip if inside workflow.)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (code implemented). This ensures review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$code-simplifier"** — Simplify implementation
- **"$integration-test"** — Generate/update integration tests from test specs
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Standalone Review Gate (Non-Workflow Only)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION:** If this skill is called **outside a workflow** (standalone `$code`), you MUST ATTENTION create a task tracking todo task for `$review-changes` as the **last task** in your task list. This ensures all changes are reviewed before commit even without a workflow enforcing it.
>
> If already running inside a workflow (e.g., `feature`, `refactor`), skip this — the workflow sequence handles `$review-changes` at the appropriate step.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

**AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
**Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
**Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
**Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
**Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
**When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
**Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
**Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
**Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
**Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
**Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
