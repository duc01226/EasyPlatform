## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Land the selected plan phase as working, fully-tested, reviewed, user-approved code — executing it phase-by-phase through testing, code review, and approval gates — committed only after every quality gate (100% tests, 0 critical issues, explicit approval) passes — NEVER bypass a gate to declare done.

> **Renamed:** folds the former `/code-auto` (→ `--approval=off`), `/code-no-test` (→ `--tests=off`), and `/code-parallel` (→ `--parallel`) skills — those names no longer resolve as slash commands; use `$code` with the matching flag.

**Workflow:**

1. **Plan Detection** — Find latest plan or use provided path, select next incomplete phase
2. **Analysis & Tasks** — Extract tasks from phase file into task tracking
3. **Implementation** — Implement step-by-step, run type checks
4. **Testing** — Call tester subagent; must reach 100% pass before proceeding
5. **Code Review** — Call code-reviewer subagent; must reach 0 critical issues
6. **User Approval** — BLOCKING gate: wait for explicit user approval
7. **Finalize** — Update status, docs, and auto-commit

**Key Rules:**

- Tests must be 100% passing (Step 3 gate)
- Critical issues must be 0 (Step 4 gate)
- User must explicitly approve before finalize (Step 5 gate)
- One plan phase per command run
- **Mode flags** (see [Mode Flags](#mode-flags)): `--approval=off` (auto/trust, no approval gate + optional all-phases loop), `--tests=off` (skip the test step), `--parallel` (dispatch parallel phases to subagents). No flags = full 7-step spine below.

**MUST ATTENTION READ** `CLAUDE.md` then **THINK HARDER** to start working on the following plan:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

<plan>$ARGUMENTS</plan>

---

## Mode Flags

`$code` runs the full step spine below by default. Optional flags adapt the spine for the cases formerly served by dedicated skills — each flag only adds or removes a single step against the **host step numbering** (Step 3 Testing, Step 4 Code Review, Step 5 User Approval, Step 6 Finalize); the shared spine and every quality bar are otherwise unchanged.

| Flag                   | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--approval={on\|off}` | `on`    | `off` = **trust/auto mode**: skip the Step 5 user-approval blocking gate and finalize without waiting. Pair with `$ALL_PHASES` to run every incomplete phase in one pass. |
| `--tests={on\|off}`    | `on`    | `off` = skip the Step 3 Testing gate entirely (Implementation → Code Review → Approval → Finalize only). Use ONLY when the plan explicitly defers tests.                  |
| `--parallel`           | off     | In Step 2, dispatch `fullstack-developer` subagents per parallel phase with strict file-ownership boundaries instead of implementing sequentially in the main agent.      |

**`$ALL_PHASES` (only meaningful with `--approval=off`):** `Yes` (default in auto mode) processes ALL incomplete phases in one run, auto-looping to the next phase after each Finalize; `No` implements one phase then asks before continuing. With `--approval=on` (default), always one phase per run.

### Flag-modified step behavior

- **`--parallel` → Step 2 (Implementation):** First read the plan for a Dependency graph / Execution strategy / Parallelization info / File-ownership matrix. **If** the plan declares parallel-executable phases → launch multiple `fullstack-developer` subagents simultaneously, passing each its phase-file path, environment info, and exact file-ownership boundaries (no cross-boundary edits); wait for the parallel group, verify no file conflicts, then run any dependent sequential phases one agent at a time. **Else** → fall back to normal sequential main-agent implementation. All later steps (Testing, Review, Approval, Finalize) run unchanged on the merged result.
- **`--tests=off` → Step 3 (Testing):** Skip entirely. Proceed Implementation → Code Review. The Source/test drift check still applies to any tests that already exist. Keep existing tests real and genuinely passing — NEVER comment out tests, weaken assertions, or use fake data to make them pass — why: faked green hides the regression the test exists to catch.
- **`--approval=off` → Step 5 (User Approval):** Skip the blocking gate. Finalize (status, docs, auto-commit) runs once Steps 1-4 pass. When `$ALL_PHASES=Yes`, loop back to Step 0 for the next incomplete phase; on the last phase, generate the summary report and ask about `/preview`.

> **Behavior preserved:** the debugger-trace gate, granularity gate, testing/review quality bars, and all SYNC blocks apply in EVERY mode. Flags change _which gates run_, never _how rigorously a running gate is enforced_.

---

## Pre-Implementation Granularity Gate (MANDATORY)

<HARD-GATE>

If ANY check fails → STOP. Ask user: "Phase needs more detail before implementation. Refine with $plan? [Y/n]"
Implement only phases with named files, concrete actions, and resolved decisions — DO NOT implement a phase containing planning verbs, unnamed files, or unresolved decisions.
</HARD-GATE>

---

## Step 0: Plan Detection & Phase Selection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:**

1. Find latest `plan.md` in `./plans`
2. Parse plan for phases and status, auto-select next incomplete (prefer IN_PROGRESS or earliest Planned)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:** Use that plan and detect which phase to work on.

**Output:** `✓ Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]`

---

## Workflow Sequence

**Rules:** Follow steps 1-6 in order. Each step requires output marker `✓ Step N:`. Mark each complete in task tracking before proceeding. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Analysis & Task Extraction

Read plan file completely. Map dependencies. List ambiguities. Identify required skills and activate from catalog. If the plan references analysis files in `.ai/workspace/analysis/`, re-read them before implementation.

**Goal Contract read (BEFORE any code change):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the current request via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md` — and read its saved success criteria. After implementation/verification (Step 3+), append an Iteration Log entry with evidence and remaining gaps.

**Pre-Implementation Trace Gate:** If the plan is for a bugfix, failed verification, stale/incorrect final output, regression, or behavior-changing fix, MUST ATTENTION verify the plan or referenced analysis includes `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and report the missing trace links instead of implementing.

**task tracking Initialization:**

- Initialize task tracking with `Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]` and all steps (1-6)
- Read phase file, look for tasks/steps/phases/sections/numbered/bulleted lists
- Convert to task tracking tasks with UNIQUE names:
    - Phase Implementation tasks → Step 2.X (Step 2.1, Step 2.2, etc.)
    - Phase Testing tasks → Step 3.X
    - Phase Code Review tasks → Step 4.X

**Output:** `✓ Step 1: Found [N] tasks across [M] phases - Ambiguities: [list or "none"]`

---

## Step 2: Implementation

Implement selected plan phase step-by-step following extracted tasks. Mark tasks complete as done. UI work → call `ui-ux-designer` subagent. Run type check + compile to verify.

**Output:** `✓ Step 2: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete, compilation passed`

---

## Step 3: Testing

Call `tester` subagent. ANY tests fail → STOP, call `debugger` subagent, fix, re-run. Repeat until 100% pass.

**Testing standards:** Unit tests may use mocks. Integration tests use test environment. Forbidden: commenting out tests, changing assertions to pass, TODO/FIXME to defer fixes.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3: Tests [X/X passed] - All requirements met`

**Validation:** If X ≠ total, Step 3 INCOMPLETE - do not proceed.

---

## Step 4: Code Review

Call `code-reviewer` subagent. Critical issues found → STOP, fix, re-run `tester`, re-run `code-reviewer`. Repeat until no critical issues.

**Output:** `✓ Step 4: Code reviewed - [0] critical issues`

**Validation:** If critical issues > 0, Step 4 INCOMPLETE - do not proceed.

---

## Step 5: User Approval ⏸ BLOCKING GATE

Present summary (3-5 bullets): what implemented, tests passed, code review outcome.

**Ask user explicitly:** "Phase implementation complete. All tests pass, code reviewed. Approve changes?"

**Stop and wait** - do not proceed until user responds.

**Output:** `✓ Step 5: User approved - Ready to complete`

---

## Step 6: Finalize

**Prerequisites:** User approved in Step 5.

1. **STATUS UPDATE (PARALLEL):**
    - Call `project-manager` subagent to update plan status
    - Call `docs-manager` subagent to update documentation

2. **ONBOARDING CHECK:** Detect onboarding requirements + generate summary.

3. **AUTO-COMMIT:** Call `git-manager` subagent. Run only if Steps 1-2 successful + User approved + Tests passed.

**Output:** `✓ Step 6: Finalize - Status updated - Git committed`

---

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, a refactor, a test, or an abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated design that
  isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Critical Enforcement Rules

**Step output format:** `✓ Step [N]: [Brief status] - [Key metrics]`

**task tracking tracking required:** Initialize at Step 0, mark each step complete before next.

**Mandatory subagent calls:** Step 3: `tester` | Step 4: `code-reviewer` | Step 6: `project-manager` AND `docs-manager` AND `git-manager`

**Blocking gates:**

- Step 3: Tests must be 100% passing
- Step 4: Critical issues must be 0
- Step 5: User must explicitly approve

Execute every step in declared order; proceed only when validation passes and the user has approved; run one plan phase per command. Do not skip steps, proceed on failed validation, or assume approval without a user response.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-refactor` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → plan → code → review → sre-review → test → docs
> 2. **Execute `$code` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via a direct user question. Skip if inside workflow.)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (code implemented). This ensures review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$code-simplifier"** — Simplify implementation
- **"$integration-test"** — Generate/update integration tests from test specs
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Standalone Review Gate (Non-Workflow Only)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION:** If this skill is called **outside a workflow** (standalone `$code`), you MUST ATTENTION create a task tracking todo task for `$review-changes` as the **last task** in your task list. This ensures all changes are reviewed before commit even without a workflow enforcing it.
>
> If already running inside a workflow (e.g., `workflow-feature`, `workflow-refactor`), skip this — the workflow sequence handles `$review-changes` at the appropriate step.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

- `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)
- `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — Styling/BEM guide (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — Design system tokens (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace -->

> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Land the selected plan phase as working, fully-tested, reviewed, user-approved code — committed only after every quality gate (100% tests, 0 critical issues, explicit approval) passes — NEVER bypass a gate to declare done.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute Steps 0-6 in declared order; tests 100% (Step 3), critical issues 0 (Step 4), explicit user approval (Step 5) are BLOCKING gates — NEVER skip a step or proceed on failed validation — why: a faked-green gate ships the regression it exists to catch.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via a direct user question — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ `CLAUDE.md` before starting

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

---

> **Closing reminder — Easy to Change is the success metric.** Every finding,
> test, refactor, and abstraction must answer one question: _does this make
> the next change cheaper or more expensive?_ If it doesn't reduce future
> change cost, reject it. Coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, and
> unclear intent are the real enemies — call them out by name.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/hooks/lib/prompt-injections.cjs` + `.claude/.ck.json`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
