## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create isolated git worktrees for parallel feature development with automatic branch naming and env file setup.

**Workflow:**

1. **Get Repo Info** — Run `worktree.cjs info` to detect repo type, base branch, env files
2. **Detect Prefix** — Infer branch prefix from keywords (fix, feat, refactor, docs, etc.)
3. **Convert Slug** — Transform description to kebab-case slug (max 50 chars)
4. **Execute** — Run `worktree.cjs create` with project, slug, prefix, and env files

**Key Rules:**

- For monorepos, ask user which project if not specified
- Always ask which env files to copy via ask the user directly
- Handle error codes (BRANCH_CHECKED_OUT, WORKTREE_EXISTS, etc.) gracefully

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Create an isolated git worktree for parallel feature development.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Repository Info

```bash
node .claude/scripts/worktree.cjs info --json
```

**Response fields:**

- `repoType`: "monorepo" or "standalone"
- `baseBranch`: detected base branch
- `projects`: array of {name, path} for monorepo
- `envFiles`: array of .env\* files found
- `dirtyState`: boolean

### Step 2: Gather Info via ask the user directly

**Detect branch prefix from user's description:**

- Keywords "fix", "bug", "error", "issue" → prefix = `fix`
- Keywords "refactor", "restructure", "rewrite" → prefix = `refactor`
- Keywords "docs", "documentation", "readme" → prefix = `docs`
- Keywords "test", "spec", "coverage" → prefix = `test`
- Keywords "chore", "cleanup", "deps" → prefix = `chore`
- Keywords "perf", "performance", "optimize" → prefix = `perf`
- Everything else → prefix = `feat`

**For MONOREPO:** Use ask the user directly if project not specified:

```javascript
// If user said "$worktree add auth" but multiple projects exist
ask the user directly({
    questions: [
        {
            header: 'Project',
            question: 'Which project should the worktree be created for?',
            options: projects.map(p => ({ label: p.name, description: p.path })),
            multiSelect: false
        }
    ]
});
```

**For env files:** Always ask which to copy:

```javascript
ask the user directly({
    questions: [
        {
            header: 'Env files',
            question: 'Which environment files should be copied to the worktree?',
            options: envFiles.map(f => ({ label: f, description: 'Copy to worktree' })),
            multiSelect: true
        }
    ]
});
```

### Step 3: Convert Description to Slug

- "add authentication system" → `add-auth`
- "fix login bug" → `login-bug`
- Remove filler words, kebab-case, max 50 chars

### Step 4: Execute Command

**Monorepo:**

```bash
node .claude/scripts/worktree.cjs create "<PROJECT>" "<SLUG>" --prefix <TYPE> --env "<FILES>"
```

**Standalone:**

```bash
node .claude/scripts/worktree.cjs create "<SLUG>" --prefix <TYPE> --env "<FILES>"
```

**Options:**

- `--prefix` - Branch type: feat|fix|refactor|docs|test|chore|perf
- `--env` - Comma-separated .env files to copy
- `--json` - Output JSON for parsing
- `--dry-run` - Preview without executing

## Commands

## Example Session

```
User: $worktree fix the login validation bug

Claude: [Runs: node .claude/scripts/worktree.cjs info --json]
        [Detects: standalone repo, envFiles: [".env.example"]]
        [Detects prefix from "fix" keyword: fix]
        [Converts slug: "login-validation-bug"]

Claude: [Uses ask the user directly for env files]
        "Which environment files should be copied?"
        Options: .env.example

User: .env.example

Claude: [Runs: node .claude/scripts/worktree.cjs create "login-validation-bug" --prefix fix --env ".env.example"]

Output: Worktree created at ../worktrees/myrepo-login-validation-bug

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

<!-- CODEX:SYNC-PROMPT-PROTOCOLS:START -->

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/hooks/lib/prompt-injections.cjs` + `.claude/.ck.json`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure unless the user explicitly invoked a workflow/skill and the local protocol treats explicit invocation as confirmation:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
