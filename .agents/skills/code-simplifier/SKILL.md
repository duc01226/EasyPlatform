## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:START -->

> **[BLOCKING]** Execute skill steps in declared order. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval.
> **[BLOCKING]** Before each step or sub-skill call, update task tracking: set `in_progress` when step starts, set `completed` when step ends.
> **[BLOCKING]** Every completed/skipped step MUST include brief evidence or explicit skip reason.
> **[BLOCKING]** If Task tools are unavailable, create and maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with the same status transitions.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:END -->

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first -->

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

> **Design Patterns Quality** — Priority checks for every code change:
>
> 1. **DRY via OOP:** Identify classes/modules with the same purpose, naming pattern, or lifecycle. Apply your knowledge of the project's language/framework to determine the idiomatic abstraction (base class, mixin, trait, protocol, decorator). 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
> 2. **Right Responsibility:** Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
> 3. **SOLID:** Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
> 4. **After extraction/move/rename:** Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
> 5. **YAGNI gate:** NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
>
> **Anti-patterns to flag:** God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.
>
> **Serial Attention for Design Quality** — DO NOT scan all quality concerns simultaneously. Split attention misses violations that focused passes catch.
>
> 1. **Identify applicable dimensions** — Based on the code's language, domain, and patterns, determine which quality dimensions apply: DRY, SOLID principles (SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP), OOP idioms, cohesion/coupling, GRASP, Law of Demeter, CQRS invariants, etc. Your list is NOT fixed — derive from what the code actually does.
> 2. **One focused pass per dimension** — Dedicate single-focus attention to EACH dimension in sequence. Do NOT mix concerns across passes.
> 3. **Threshold: 3+ similar patterns = MANDATORY extraction** — Not optional suggestion. Flag as mandatory structural fix requiring action.
> 4. **2+ violations of same kind = structural finding** — Report as "pattern problem" needing architectural resolution, not a list of individual instances.

<!-- /SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

<!-- SYNC:complexity-prevention -->

> **Complexity Prevention (Ousterhout)** — MANDATORY. Measure code by cost of change: one business change should map to one code change. Flag ALL of the following in review:
>
> 1. **Change amplification** — small business change forces edits in >3 places → structural flaw. Count edit sites for a plausible future change (add variant, add field, add authorization). >3 = reject.
> 2. **Cognitive load** — reader must hold too much context to safely modify. Flag deep inheritance, long parameter lists, boolean traps, implicit ordering dependencies.
> 3. **Cross-cutting duplication at entry points** — logging, error handling, validation, auth, transactions reimplemented per controller/handler/route. Lift to middleware / interceptor / filter / decorator / aspect.
> 4. **Leaked implementation technology** — repos returning `IQueryable`/`QuerySet`/`Criteria`/raw cursors/ORM entities to callers. Return finished results + intent-revealing methods (`GetActiveVipUsers()` not `Query()`).
> 5. **Type-switch scattering** — `switch`/`if`-chains on enum/discriminator in >1 place. New variant = new file, not N edits. One factory/registry switch at the boundary OK; scattered switches = reject.
> 6. **Anemic models** — domain objects with only getters/setters, logic floats in services. Move invariants/behavior onto the object (`order.Checkout()`, not `order.Status = ...`).
> 7. **Primitive obsession** — raw `string`/`int`/`decimal` for account numbers, emails, money, percentages, date ranges, with re-validation at every entry. Wrap in value objects / records / structs that validate once at construction.
> 8. **Inline cross-cutting concerns** — authorization/tenant isolation/audit/sanitization hand-written at top of every handler. Flag intent with declarative markers (`@RequirePermission("Order.Delete")`), enforce once centrally.
> 9. **Shallow modules** — tiny class, big interface (many public methods, many flags, many ctor params) wrapping little logic. A module is deep when a small interface hides a lot of implementation. If interface ≈ implementation cost to learn → inline.
> 10. **Missing base class for repeated component/handler lifecycle** — 3+ forms/CRUD handlers/list views reimplementing loading/dirty/submit/pagination → extract to base class / hook / composable / mixin / trait.
> 11. **Premature vs delayed abstraction** — rule-of-three. First occurrence: write it. Second: notice duplication. Third: extract. Don't build generic frameworks before real variation; don't copy-paste for the 4th time.
> 12. **Embedded utility logic not extracted to helpers** — inline paging loops (`while (hasMore) { skip += take; ... }`), ad-hoc datetime math, string parsing/formatting, collection partitioning, retry/backoff loops, URL/query-string building. If the algorithm is non-trivial AND stack-generic (not business-specific), extract to `util`/`helper`/`extensions` and let consumers call one line. Inline duplicates → duplicated bug surface.
> 13. **Logic in wrong (higher) layer — downshift to callee** — business/derivation logic written in the caller when the callee owns the data. Defaults: Controller code that should be App Service. App Service code that should be Domain Service or Entity. Component code that should be ViewModel/Store/Service. Caller reaching into callee's data shape to compute something → move the computation behind an intent-revealing method on the callee. Lowest responsible layer wins (Entity > Domain Service > App Service > Controller · Model/VM > Store > Component). Higher-layer placement = duplicated logic when a sibling caller needs the same thing.
> 14. **Owner owns the rule — extract on first write** — if a caller inlines logic that derives, normalizes, validates, or computes from another type's data, MOVE it to the owning type. Single use is sufficient — the trigger is wrong responsibility, not duplication. Sibling callers always arrive; inline copies drift silently with no compile error and no name to grep. **Common offenders:** _Backend_ — inlined rules in application-layer handlers / commands / queries / services / controllers that belong on the domain entity / value object / domain service. _Frontend_ — inlined derivations / formatting / validation in components that belong on the model / store / view-model / API service. **Fix:** name the rule once as a method (static or instance) on the owning type; callers invoke by name. Future variant → SECOND named method on the owner, never an inline near-duplicate. **Right responsibility first; reuse is the consequence.**
>
> **Extraction target — where the named rule lives:**
>
> | Shape of the rule                             | Goes to                       |
> | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | Pure function over an entity's own data       | static method on the entity   |
> | Behavior that mutates / guards entity state   | instance method on the entity |

> | Change a derivation of entity data              | 1 method on the entity    |
>
> **Operating heuristics:**
>
> - Write the call site first.
> - Count edit sites for plausible future change.
> - Prefer removing code over adding it.
> - Surface assumptions at boundaries, hide details inside.
> - **Pre-reuse scan** — before writing a non-trivial block, grep for similar algorithms (`while.*skip`, `DateTime.*Add`, `split`/`join` chains, paging loops, retry loops). Match existing helper → call it. None exists but pattern is stack-generic → extract to util before second caller appears.
> - **Layer placement test** — ask "if a sibling caller needed this tomorrow, would they re-derive it?" If yes, the logic is in the wrong layer. Move it down.
> - **Open-case-for-future-reuse** — if reviewer spots a block that is likely to appear in another feature (domain-agnostic algorithm, shared lifecycle, recurring derivation), do NOT rationalize with pure YAGNI. Either extract now (if cheap) or create a tracked TODO with the exact extraction target so the second caller does not duplicate silently. Silent duplication is the default failure mode.
> - When in doubt ask: "What would need to change if the requirement shifts?"
>
> **The measure of good code is the cost of change.** Not shortest. Not cleverest. Not most abstracted. Cheapest to safely modify having read a small local portion.

<!-- /SYNC:complexity-prevention -->

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (Codex has no hook injection — open this file directly before proceeding)

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings to `plans/reports/`. Prevents context loss, serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first).

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — flag duplicated patterns for base class extraction. Same-suffix classes (`*Entity`, `*Dto`, `*Service`) MUST ATTENTION inherit common base. Verify stack has linting/analyzer configured.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Simplify and refine code for clarity, consistency, maintainability — preserving all functionality.

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Plan task to READ:
>
> - `docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md` — anti-patterns, review checklists **(READ FIRST)**
> - `project-structure-reference.md` — project patterns/structure
>
> If not found, search for: project documentation, coding standards, architecture docs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Phase 0: Detect** — Classify artifact type (backend/frontend/test/config) and scope
2. **Identify Targets** — Recent git changes or specified files (skip generated/vendor)
3. **Analyze** — Apply simplification dimensions (see below)
4. **Apply** — One refactoring type at a time following KISS/DRY/YAGNI
5. **Verify** — Run related tests, confirm no behavior changes
6. **Fresh-Context Review** — Spawn code-reviewer sub-agent (MANDATORY)

**Key Rules:**

- Preserve all existing functionality — no behavior changes
- Follow platform patterns (entity expressions, fluent helpers, store base, BEM)
- Tests pass after every change
- NEVER apply simplification when unsure it preserves behavior

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When task involves frontend/UI changes:

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-system-context -->

## Phase 0: Artifact Detection

**MUST ATTENTION** classify before simplifying — detection drives focus and sub-agent routing:

| Artifact Type      | Detection                   | Key Focus                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend (C#/.NET)  | `.cs` files                 | Entity expressions, fluent API, DRY via OOP, SOLID    |
| Frontend (TS/HTML) | `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`     | BEM, store base, subscription cleanup, component base |
| Tests              | `*Test.cs`, `*.spec.ts`     | Assertions, `WaitUntilAsync`, data isolation          |
| Config/Generated   | Migrations, `*.generated.*` | **SKIP** — NEVER simplify generated/migration code    |

Sub-agent routing by artifact:

| Artifact             | Sub-agent               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Source code/diffs    | `code-reviewer`         |
| Security-sensitive   | `security-auditor`      |
| Performance-critical | `performance-optimizer` |
| Plans/docs/specs     | `general-purpose`       |

## Simplification Mindset

**Skeptical-first:** Verify before simplifying. Every change needs proof it preserves behavior.

- NEVER assume code redundant — trace call paths and read implementations first
- Before removing/replacing: grep all usages confirming nothing depends on current form
- Before flagging convention violation: grep 3+ existing examples — codebase convention wins
- Every simplification requires `file:line` evidence of what was verified
- If unsure whether simplification preserves behavior → DO NOT apply

## Simplification Dimensions

Dimension-based reasoning replaces fixed checklists. Each dimension has a `Think:` prompt forcing first-principles reasoning.

### Dimension 1: Readability

> **Think:** Would a new engineer understand this in 30 seconds? What forces multiple file traces?

- Schema visibility: functions computing data structures need output-shape comment
- Non-obvious pipelines: A→B→C transformations need brief pipeline explanation
- Self-documenting signatures: params explain role; remove unused params
- Magic values: replace unexplained numbers/strings with named constants
- Naming clarity: names reveal intent without reading implementation

### Dimension 2: DRY & Abstraction

> **Think:** Pattern appearing ≥3 places? What base class/generic eliminates duplication?

- Same-suffix classes (`*Entity`, `*Dto`, `*Service`) → shared base
- Repeated logic blocks → extract to helper/extension method
- YAGNI gate: NEVER extract for hypothetical future use — 3+ occurrences required

### Dimension 3: Right Responsibility

> **Think:** Logic in lowest layer that can own it? Could moving it down enable reuse?

- `Entity/Model → Domain Service → Application Service → Controller` (logic belongs lowest)
- Business logic in controllers → move down
- Mapping in handlers → move to DTO methods

### Dimension 4: Complexity Reduction

> **Think:** What is cognitive load? Can nesting/conditionals flatten?

- Nesting >3 → refactor (early returns, extract methods)
- Methods >20 lines → extract
- Complex conditionals → flatten or Strategy pattern (3+ branching occurrences only)

### Dimension 5: Database Performance

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION**
>
> 1. **Paging:** ALL list queries MUST use pagination. NEVER unbounded `GetAll()`, `ToList()`, `Find()` without `Skip/Take` or cursor-based paging.
> 2. **Indexes:** ALL filter fields, foreign keys, sort columns MUST have database indexes. Entity expressions must match index field order. Collections need index management methods.

## Project Patterns

### Backend

- Extract entity static expressions (search: entity expression pattern)
- Use fluent helpers (search: fluent helper pattern in `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`)
- Move mapping to DTO mapping methods (search: DTO mapping pattern)
- Use project validation fluent API (see `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`)
- Verify entity expressions have database indexes
- Verify document DB collections have index management methods

### Frontend

- Use project store base (search: store base class) for state management
- Apply subscription cleanup (search: subscription cleanup pattern) to all subscriptions
- BEM class naming on ALL template elements
- Use platform base classes (search: base component class, store component base class)

## Graph Intelligence (MANDATORY if graph.db exists)

Before simplifying, trace what depends on target:

```
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction downstream --json
```

Verify simplified code preserves same interface for all traced consumers. Cross-service MESSAGE_BUS consumers are especially fragile — may depend on exact message shape.

Additional queries:

- Verify no callers break: `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <function> --json`
- Check dependents: `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <module> --json`
- Batch analysis: `python .claude/scripts/code_graph batch-query file1 file2 --json`

## Execution

```
spawn_agent(agent_type="code-simplifier", prompt="Review and simplify [target files]")
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// Before
function getData() {
    const result = fetchData();
    if (result !== null && result !== undefined) {
        return result;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

// After
function getData() {
    return fetchData() ?? null;
}
```

## Constraints

- **Preserve functionality** — no behavior changes
- **Tests passing** — verify after every change
- **Follow patterns** — use platform conventions, never invent
- **Doc staleness** — cross-ref changed files against feature docs, test specs, READMEs; flag updates needed

<!-- SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy -->

> **Shared Protocol Duplication Policy** — Inline protocol content in skills (wrapped in `<!-- SYNC:tag -->`) is INTENTIONAL duplication. Do NOT extract, deduplicate, or replace with file references. AI compliance drops significantly when protocols are behind file-read indirection. To update: edit `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` first, then grep `SYNC:protocol-name` and update all occurrences.

<!-- /SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy -->

---

## Fresh Sub-Agent Verification (MANDATORY after simplifications in a review workflow)

After simplifications applied, verification requires **fresh sub-agent review** to eliminate confirmation bias. See SYNC blocks below.

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

> **Deep Multi-Round Review** — Escalating rounds. Round 1 in main session. Round 2+ and EVERY recursive re-review iteration MUST use a fresh sub-agent.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output baseline findings.
>
> **Round 2:** MANDATORY fresh sub-agent review — see `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. The sub-agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with ZERO Round 1 memory. It must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in Round 1
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the main session rationalized away
>
> **Round 3+ (recursive after fixes):** After ANY fix cycle, MANDATORY fresh sub-agent re-review. Spawn a **NEW** `spawn_agent` tool call each iteration — never reuse Round 2's agent. Each new agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with full protocol injection. Continue until PASS or **3 fresh-subagent rounds max**, then escalate to user via a direct user question.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER declare PASS after Round 1 alone
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW Agent call
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — if still FAIL, escalate via a direct user question (do NOT silently loop)
> - Track round count in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2.**

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Sub-Agent Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias via isolated sub-agents.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `$cook`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** Round 2 of ANY review AND every recursive re-review iteration after fixes. NOT needed when Round 1 already PASSes with zero issues.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Spawn a NEW `spawn_agent` tool call — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW `spawn_agent` call
> - NEVER skip fresh-subagent review because "last round was clean" — every fix triggers a fresh round
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — escalate via a direct user question if still failing; do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol
> - Track iteration count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

<!-- /SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

<!-- SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 10 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 10 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 10 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
spawn_agent({
description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
agent_type: "code-reviewer",
prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: JS: === vs ==, typeof null. C#: async void, missing using, LINQ deferred execution.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Complexity Prevention (Ousterhout)
MANDATORY. Measure code by cost of change: one business change = one code change. Flag ALL 13:
1. Change amplification — >3 edit sites for plausible future change = structural flaw. Reject.
2. Cognitive load — deep inheritance, long param lists, boolean traps, implicit ordering = reader overload.
3. Cross-cutting duplication at entry points — logging/error/validation/auth/tx reimplemented per handler → lift to middleware/interceptor/filter/decorator/aspect.
4. Leaked implementation technology — repos returning IQueryable/QuerySet/raw cursors/ORM entities → return finished results + intent-revealing methods.
5. Type-switch scattering — switch/if-chains on enum/discriminator in >1 place → polymorphism/strategy. New variant = 1 new file, not N edits.
6. Anemic models — getters/setters only, logic in services → move invariants/behavior onto object (`order.Checkout()`, not `order.Status = ...`).
7. Primitive obsession — raw string/int/decimal for account/email/money/percent/date-range → value objects / records / structs validating once at construction.
8. Inline cross-cutting concerns — authz/tenant/audit/sanitization at top of every handler → declarative markers (`@RequirePermission`), enforce centrally.
9. Shallow modules — tiny class, big interface wrapping little logic → inline or deepen.
10. Missing base class for repeated component/handler lifecycle — 3+ forms/CRUD handlers/list views reimplementing loading/dirty/submit/pagination → base class/hook/composable/mixin/trait.
11. Premature vs delayed abstraction — rule-of-three. First write it; second notice; third extract. No generic frameworks before real variation; no copy-paste for the 4th time.
12. Embedded utility logic not extracted — inline paging/retry/datetime/string parsing/URL building → extract to util/helper/extensions. Inline duplicates = duplicated bug surface.
13. Logic in wrong (higher) layer — caller computing what callee owns → downshift. Lowest responsible layer wins (Entity > Domain Service > App Service > Controller · Model/VM > Store > Component).
Pre-commit edit-site test (reject if answer is "many"): Add new variant → 1 new file. Change HTTP error format → 1 middleware. Add timestamp to every entity → 1 base/interceptor. Add authorization to an endpoint → 1 declarative marker. Swap DB/ORM → data layer only. Change business calculation → 1 method on entity. Add loading pattern to forms → 1 base/hook. Add validation to primitive → 1 value-object ctor. Change paging/retry/datetime algorithm → 1 helper. Change entity derivation → 1 method on entity.
Heuristics: write call site first · count edit sites for plausible future change · pre-reuse scan (grep similar algorithms before writing) · layer placement test ("would a sibling caller re-derive this?") · open-case-for-future-reuse (don't rationalize silent duplication with pure YAGNI — extract now if cheap or track TODO) · prefer removing code · surface assumptions at boundaries, hide details inside.
The measure of good code is the cost of change.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. From changed files → find TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} in docs/business-features/{Service}/detailed-features/{Feature}.md Section 15.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding TC (or flag as "needs TC").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Verify TC evidence fields point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
5. Auth changes → TC-{FEAT}-02x exist? Data changes → TC-{FEAT}-01x exist?
6. If no specs exist → log gap and recommend $tdd-spec.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need task tracking. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 10 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- /SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

When used standalone (outside a review workflow), run `$workflow-review-changes` to trigger the full review cycle with fresh sub-agent re-review.

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If NOT already in workflow, use a direct user question to ask user. Do NOT decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides:
>
> 1. **Activate `quality-audit` workflow** (Recommended) — code-simplifier → review-changes → code-review
> 2. **Execute `$code-simplifier` directly** — run standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing, use a direct user question:

- **"$workflow-review-changes (Recommended)"** — Review all changes before commit
- **"$code-review"** — Full code review
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## AI Agent Integrity Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **Completion ≠ Correctness.** Before reporting work done, prove it:
>
> 1. **Grep every removed name.** Extraction/rename/delete → grep confirms 0 dangling refs across ALL file types.
> 2. **Ask WHY before changing.** Existing values intentional until proven otherwise. No "fix" without traced rationale.
> 3. **Verify ALL outputs.** One build passing ≠ all builds passing. Check every affected stack.
> 4. **Evaluate pattern fit.** Copying nearby code? Verify preconditions match — same scope, lifetime, base class, constraints.
> 5. **New artifact = wired artifact.** Created? Prove registered, imported, reachable by all consumers.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
