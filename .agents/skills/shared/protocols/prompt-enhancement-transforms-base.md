> **Prompt Enhancement Transforms (Base)** — Transforms 1-3 are identical across all `$prompt-enhance` ops (`--op=compress|expand|enhance`). Transform 4 is per-op (conciseness pass for compress/enhance; structural clarity pass for expand) and stays local to each op branch.
>
> ### Transform 1: Inline Summaries for READ References
>
> **Problem:** AI sees `MUST ATTENTION READ file.md` and skips it.
> **Solution:** Add a 2-3 line summary of key rules BEFORE the read instruction.
>
> **Before:**
>
> ```
> MUST ATTENTION READ .claude/protocols/evidence.md
> ```
>
> **After:**
>
> ```
> > **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim requires `file:line` proof.
> > Confidence: >95% recommend freely, 80-94% with caveats, 60-79% cautiously, <60% DO NOT recommend.
>
> MUST ATTENTION READ .claude/protocols/evidence.md for full details.
> ```
>
> **Scope rules:**
>
> - `.claude/` protocol files → always add an inline summary (stable, belongs to framework)
> - Files under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) → NO inline summary (project-specific). Add: `(Hooks may point to this file, but every host must open it directly using docs-index routing when the context is needed)`
>
> ### Transform 2: Top Summary Section
>
> Required structure (first 20 lines after frontmatter):
>
> ```markdown
> > **[IMPORTANT]** todo tracking instruction...
>
> > **Protocol Name** — [inline summary]. MUST ATTENTION READ `path` for details.
>
> ## Quick Summary
>
> **Goal:** [One sentence — what this skill achieves AND the ultimate outcome it must cause]
>
> **Summary:** [2-4 bullets/sentences — the key important things + the steps AI must notice; the read-this-if-nothing-else digest, distinct altitude from the enumerated Workflow/Key Rules below]
>
> **Workflow:**
>
> 1. **[Step]** — [description]
>
> **Key Rules:**
>
> - [Most critical constraint]
> ```
>
> ### Transform 3: Bottom Closing Reminders
>
> Add at the very end of the file:
>
> ```markdown
> ---
>
> ## Closing Reminders
>
> **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** [same goal as Quick Summary]
> **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [echo rule #1 from the top section]
> **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [echo rule #2]
> **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [echo rule #3]
> **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify work quality
> ```
>
> Pick 3-5 rules AI most commonly violates. Bottom section re-anchors attention after the long middle.
