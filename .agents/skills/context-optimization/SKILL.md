## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Manage context window efficiently to maintain productivity in long Claude Code sessions.

**Workflow:**

1. **Write** — Save critical findings to persistent memory entities
2. **Select** — Retrieve relevant memories at session/task start
3. **Compress** — Create context anchors every 10 operations summarizing progress
4. **Isolate** — Delegate exploration tasks to sub-agents to reduce context usage

**Key Rules:**

- Write context anchor every 10 operations (re-read task, verify alignment, summarize)
- Use offset/limit and grep before reading large files
- Combine search patterns with OR instead of sequential searches
- At 100K tokens: required compression; at 150K: critical save and summarize

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Four Context Strategies

### 1. Writing (Save Important Context)

Save critical findings to persistent memory:

```javascript
// After discovering important patterns or decisions
mcp__memory__create_entities([
    {
        name: 'EmployeeValidation',
        entityType: 'Pattern',
        observations: ['Uses validation framework fluent API', 'Async validation via ValidateRequestAsync', 'Found in Application/UseCaseCommands/']
    }
]);
```

**When to Write:**

- Discovered architectural patterns
- Important business rules
- Cross-service dependencies
- Solution decisions

### 2. Selecting (Retrieve Relevant Context)

Load relevant memories at session start:

```javascript
// Search for relevant patterns
mcp__memory__search_nodes({ query: 'Employee validation pattern' });

// Open specific entities
mcp__memory__open_nodes({ names: ['EmployeeValidation', 'ServiceAModule'] });
```

**When to Select:**

- Starting a related task
- Continuing previous work
- Cross-referencing patterns

### 3. Compressing (Summarize Long Trajectories)

Create context anchors every 10 operations:

```markdown
=== CONTEXT ANCHOR ===
Current Task: Implement employee leave request feature
Completed:

- Created LeaveRequest entity with validation
- Added SaveLeaveRequestCommand with handler
- Implemented entity event handler for notifications

Remaining:

- Create GetLeaveRequestListQuery
- Add controller endpoint
- Write unit tests

Key Findings:

- Leave requests use service-specific repository
- Notifications via entity event handlers, not direct calls
- Validation uses validation framework fluent .AndAsync()

# Next Action: Create query handler with GetQueryBuilder pattern
```

### 4. Isolating (Use Sub-Agents)

Delegate specialized tasks to sub-agents:

```javascript
// Explore codebase (reduced context)
Task({ agent_type: 'Explore', prompt: 'Find all entity event handlers in the target service' });

// Plan implementation (focused context)
Task({ agent_type: 'Plan', prompt: 'Plan leave request approval workflow' });
```

**When to Isolate:**

- Broad codebase exploration
- Independent research tasks
- Parallel investigations

---

## Context Anchor Protocol

**Every 10 operations, write a context anchor:**

1. **Re-read original task** from todo list or initial prompt
2. **Verify alignment** with current work
3. **Write anchor** summarizing progress
4. **Save to memory** if discovering important patterns

```markdown
=== CONTEXT ANCHOR [10] ===
Task: [Original task description]
Phase: [Current phase number]
Progress: [What's been completed]
Findings: [Key discoveries]
Next: [Specific next step]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
===========================
```

---

## Token-Efficient Patterns

### File Reading

```javascript
// ❌ Reading entire files
Read({ file_path: 'large-file.cs' });

// ✅ Read specific sections
Read({ file_path: 'large-file.cs', offset: 100, limit: 50 });

// ✅ Use grep to find specific content first
Grep({ pattern: 'class SaveEmployeeCommand', path: 'src/' });
```

### Search Optimization

```javascript
// ❌ Multiple sequential searches
Grep({ pattern: 'CreateAsync' });
Grep({ pattern: 'UpdateAsync' });
Grep({ pattern: 'DeleteAsync' });

// ✅ Combined pattern
Grep({ pattern: 'CreateAsync|UpdateAsync|DeleteAsync', output_mode: 'files_with_matches' });
```

### Parallel Operations

```javascript
// ✅ Parallel reads for independent files
[Read({ file_path: 'file1.cs' }), Read({ file_path: 'file2.cs' }), Read({ file_path: 'file3.cs' })];
```

---

## Memory Management Commands

### Save Session Summary

```javascript
// Before ending session or hitting limits
const summary = {
    task: 'Implementing employee leave request feature',
    completed: ['Entity', 'Command', 'Handler'],
    remaining: ['Query', 'Controller', 'Tests'],
    discoveries: ['Use entity events for notifications'],
    files: ['LeaveRequest.cs', 'SaveLeaveRequestCommand.cs']
};

// Save to memory
mcp__memory__create_entities([
    {
        name: `Session_${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`,
        entityType: 'SessionSummary',
        observations: [JSON.stringify(summary)]
    }
]);
```

### Load Previous Session

```javascript
// At session start
mcp__memory__search_nodes({ query: 'Session leave request' });
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern               | Better Approach                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Reading entire large files | Use offset/limit or grep first |
| Sequential searches        | Combine with OR patterns       |
| Repeating same searches    | Cache results in memory        |
| No context anchors         | Write anchor every 10 ops      |
| Not using sub-agents       | Isolate exploration tasks      |
| Forgetting discoveries     | Save to memory entities        |

## Quick Reference

**Token Estimation:**

- 1 line of code ≈ 10-15 tokens
- 1 page of text ≈ 500 tokens
- Average file ≈ 1,000-3,000 tokens

**Context Thresholds:**

- 50K tokens: Consider compression
- 100K tokens: Required compression
- 150K tokens: Critical - save and summarize

**Memory Commands:**

- `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Save new knowledge
- `mcp__memory__search_nodes` - Find relevant context
- `mcp__memory__add_observations` - Update existing entities

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.

   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
