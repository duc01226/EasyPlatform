## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Eliminate the root cause of an issue using parallel subagent investigation — traced end-to-start with `file:line` evidence and fixed at the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site) — then prove the fix with `$prove-fix` so the disease is cured, not just the symptom.

**Summary:**

- Router first: with `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` jump to that self-contained inline branch (each runs its own diagnosis + `$prove-fix`); no flag = run the full diagnose→fix spine.
- Diagnose before patching — trace the symptom end-to-start to the invariant-owning layer (hypothesis matrix + forward convergence proof), and NEVER fix at the crash site: the crash site is a symptom, the cause enters at a lower layer.
- Two hard gates that cannot be skipped: the Confidence & Evidence Gate (declare `Confidence: X%` + `file:line`, STOP if <60%) and the 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix approval (present root cause + plan via a direct user question before any code change — skip approval only inside a workflow).
- Standalone (no parent workflow) self-assembles the minimum spine: `debug-investigate → fix + prove-fix → conditional $spec correctness check → $review-changes (production code) → $why-review`; inside a workflow this whole contract is SKIPPED.

**Workflow:**

1. **Scout** — Use scout/researcher subagents to explore issue in parallel
2. **Diagnose** — Trace root cause through code paths with evidence
3. **Plan** — Create fix plan with impact analysis
4. **Fix** — Implement and verify the fix

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use subagents for parallel investigation of multiple hypotheses
- Always create a plan before implementing complex fixes
- **Target flag** (see [Target Routing](#target-routing---target)): `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` selects a self-contained inline branch that scopes the fix to that domain. No flag = full diagnose→fix spine below.

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD (full rigor).** Every section below — parallel scout/researcher subagents, root-cause tracing with `file:line` evidence, Confidence & Evidence Gate, fix plan with impact analysis, preservation tests for the bug — applies by default.
>
> **Opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL true** (bug genuinely trivial):
>
> - Root cause obvious from error message AND already located (no diagnosis needed)
> - Single-file fix, ≤10 lines changed
> - No cross-service impact, no contract change
> - Test for bug already exists OR bug non-functional (typo, log message)
> - Confidence in fix ≥95% without further investigation
>
> **Any condition fails → use full protocol below.** When in doubt, default hard. Skipping diagnosis on non-trivial bug fixes symptom and leaves disease.
>
> **Fast mode skips (and only skips):** parallel subagent investigation (direct read/grep instead), separate fix plan (inline change), regression-test authoring (only if covering test exists). Does NOT skip Confidence & Evidence Gate, Behavioral Delta Matrix, or running existing test suite.

## Standalone Mode Minimum Contract (Non-Workflow Only)

> **`$fix` is normally a step inside `workflow-bugfix`** — there the sequence (`scout → investigate → debug-investigate → spec [mode=amend] → plan → … → fix → prove-fix → … → spec [mode=sync] → workflow-review-changes`) supplies the diagnosis, spec sync, and review around the fix. **Called STANDALONE, no sequence supplies them.** `$fix` alone diagnoses and patches code; it does NOT by itself guarantee the root cause was traced to its owning layer, that the Feature Spec under `docs/specs/` still matches behavior, or that the change was reviewed. Standalone, that gap is symptom-patching + spec/doc drift.
>
> **Scope:** this contract governs the **no-flag `$fix` spine** (the full diagnose→fix path). The `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branches are self-contained — each runs its own diagnosis + `$prove-fix` — so they do NOT re-run §1/§2 here; standalone, they inherit only **§3 (spec-correctness check)** and **§4 (why-review)** as their trailing gates (and `--target=issue` already owns its own `$review-changes` gate — see that branch).
>
> **Detect mode:** call the current task list first (per the Nested Task Expansion Contract below). **Active parent workflow row present → this whole section is SKIPPED** (the workflow owns these steps; duplicating them double-runs the spine). **No parent row → standalone:** before the first code edit, MUST ATTENTION self-assemble this minimum bugfix spine as task tracking todos, in order:
>
> 1. **`$debug-investigate`** — _root cause, FIRST._ Trace the symptom end-to-start to the invariant-owning layer with `file:line` evidence (hypothesis matrix + forward convergence proof). This **is** the standalone diagnosis — it subsumes the spine's internal step-1 `debugger` subagent; resume the spine from its planning step using this report. _Fast-mode-trivial bugs (ALL Default Mode Policy opt-out conditions met) MAY inline the trace instead of spawning the skill, but the end-to-start trace is still required._
> 2. **Fix spine** — _this skill's_ `plan → 🛑 approve → implement → `$prove-fix`` body below. The Validate-Before-Fix approval gate and `$prove-fix` are unchanged.
> 3. **`$spec` spec-correctness check** — _CONDITIONAL, ensures spec docs aren't left stale._ From the proven root cause, decide which case holds:
>     - **Spec was WRONG / stale** — it described behavior that was never true, or intended behavior changed and the spec wasn't updated. The spec is (part of) the defect → run `$spec [mode=amend]` to correct the §1-§7 spec, then `$spec [mode=sync]` to reconcile §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` ↔ integration tests.
>     - **Spec was CORRECT, the code just failed to meet it** — pure code defect; §1-§7 behavior now matches the spec again. **No §1-§7 amendment.** But still check the §8 test cases: if the bug reproduced a scenario/edge case that **no existing `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` covered** (the spec was _correct but lacked the bug case_), add a regression test case via `$spec [mode=tests]` so the spec captures it, then `$spec [mode=sync]` to reconcile §8 ↔ the new regression test. Only if an existing TC already covered the case do you record `Spec verified correct, bug case already in §8 — no spec change (code-only defect)` with `file:line` evidence and move on. Never leave a fixed bug whose case is absent from the spec's §8.
>     - **No governing spec exists** — the buggy area has no Feature Spec under `docs/specs/`. Record `No governing spec — nothing to amend` with `file:line` evidence; if the area now warrants one, run `$spec [mode=init]` (then `[mode=tests]` to seed §8 with the bug case as a regression TC) rather than only suggesting it. _Decide the case explicitly — skip only the amendment, never the decision; never leave the bug case undocumented when a spec governs the area._
> 4. **`$why-review`** — _rationale review, the FINAL todo (after the fix AND after any `$review-changes`)._ Terminal sign-off on the converged change: root cause correctly owned, fix at the lowest invariant-owning layer (not the crash site), no symptom-patching, regression covered, and the §3 spec decision justified. Reporting "done" is blocked until this passes. _Non-functional-trivial fixes (typo, log/comment text; fast-mode) MAY satisfy this inline/briefly rather than spawning the full skill — symmetric with §1._
>
> **Production-code fixes** also get a `$review-changes` todo **before** §4 (the broad code review whose validated fixes may change the diff; §4 then signs off on the result). `$review-changes` placement and the inside-workflow skip are owned by the shared Standalone Review Gate below — reference it; do not restate the mandate. **Final standalone todo order:** `debug-investigate → [fix spine + prove-fix] → spec-check → review-changes (if production code) → why-review`.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.**

- Verify each hypothesis against an actual code trace before acting — do NOT assume first hypothesis correct — why: the first guess is usually the nearest-attention trap, not the cause
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove root cause with code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify fix addresses traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

**Ultrathink** plan and start fixing these issues; follow Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team, Development Rules:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## Target Routing (`--target=`)

`$fix` is an intelligent router. With no flag it runs the full diagnose→fix spine below. Pass `--target=` to scope the run to a self-contained inline branch:

| `--target` | Behavior                                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `types`    | **Inline branch (below)** — TypeScript / type-error resolution. |
| `ci`       | **Inline branch (below)** — CI / pipeline failure triage.       |
| `issue`    | **Inline branch (below)** — tracked issue / ticket resolution.  |
| `logs`     | **Inline branch (below)** — log / stack-trace-driven debugging. |
| `test`     | **Inline branch (below)** — failing-test repair.                |
| `ui`       | **Inline branch (below)** — UI / visual-defect fixes.           |

No `--target` (or an unrecognized value) → run the full Workflow spine below; infer the right specialization from `<issues>`.

> **Formerly standalone skills.** `--target=ci|issue|logs|test|ui` were previously the separate skills `/fix-ci`, `/fix-issue`, `/fix-logs`, `/fix-test`, `/fix-ui`; they are now inline branches of `$fix` (folded — the standalone names no longer exist).

### `--target=types` — TypeScript / type-error branch

Run `tsc --noEmit` (or `nx build` / `bun run typecheck` / `npx tsc`) to gather all type errors, then:

1. **Collect** — Capture every type error with `file:line`.
2. **Classify** — Group by cause: missing types, wrong signatures, import/export issues.
3. **Fix at root** — Give each value its real, specific type (or `unknown` + a narrowing guard). Do NOT use `any` to silence the checker — `any` ships the underlying type defect. Fix the root cause (wrong interface, missing export), not the symptom site. — why: `any` silences the checker and lets the type defect ship.
4. **Repeat** until `tsc --noEmit` is clean — zero type errors.
5. **🛑 Validate Before Fix:** present errors + root cause via a direct user question, get approval before code changes (skip if inside a workflow).
6. **After fixing, run `$prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ci` — CI / pipeline-failure branch

**Goal:** Analyze CI/CD pipeline logs to identify and fix build/test failures in the configured CI provider/tooling.

**Key Rules:**

- **Infrastructure context:** read `docs/project-config.json` → `infrastructure.cicd.tool` to identify the CI provider/tooling (e.g. `azure-devops`, `github-actions`, `gitlab-ci`); target that provider's pipeline config files.
- Focus on CI-specific issues (env vars, Docker, dependencies, build order).
- Verify the fix does not break local development.

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `debugger` subagent to read the CI logs via the configured CI tool/API (from `docs/project-config.json`), analyze the final failing log/error **backward** to the root cause, and report back. Write findings to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{ci-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before implementing.
2. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → a direct user question → wait for approval.**
3. Implement the fix from the report.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
5. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
6. Report a summary of changes; suggest next steps. Then run `$prove-fix`.

**Notes:** Use the CLI/API for the configured CI provider. If it is GitHub Actions and `gh` is unavailable, instruct the user to install and authorize GitHub CLI first.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=issue` — tracked-issue / ticket branch

**Goal:** Investigate and fix bugs reported as tracked issues (e.g. GitHub issues) with full traceability.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the issue). Map the ticket's acceptance criteria to the saved success criteria; after the fix, append proof evidence and remaining gaps to the Iteration Log. Closure is blocked while any required criterion remains FAIL.

**Key Rules:**

- Link the fix back to the issue for traceability.
- Verify the fix addresses the specific reproduction steps from the issue.

**Workflow:**

1. Activate the `debug-investigate` skill and follow its workflow. See `.claude/docs/AI-DEBUGGING-PROTOCOL.md` for comprehensive guidelines.
2. Use external memory at `.ai/workspace/analysis/issue-[number].analysis.md` for structured analysis. **Re-read the ENTIRE analysis file before proposing any fix.**
3. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → a direct user question → wait for approval before implementing.**
4. Implement, then run `$prove-fix`.

> **Standalone Review Gate (non-workflow only):** any standalone production-code fix — the no-flag spine (Standalone Mode Minimum Contract above) **or** `$fix --target=issue` — adds a `$review-changes` task tracking todo as the **final review-changes gate**, placed immediately before the contract's §4 `$why-review` terminal sign-off (spec-check → review-changes → why-review). Inside a workflow, skip — the sequence handles `$review-changes`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=logs` — log / stack-trace branch

**Goal:** Analyze application logs to diagnose and fix runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

**Key Rules:**

- Focus on log patterns: stack traces, error codes, timing anomalies.
- Cross-reference logs with source code to find the actual root cause.

**Workflow:**

1. Check whether `./logs.txt` exists. If missing, set up permanent log piping in the project's script config (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, …): **Bash/Unix** append `2>&1 | tee logs.txt`; **PowerShell** append `*>&1 | Tee-Object logs.txt`. Run the command to generate logs.
2. Use the `debugger` subagent to analyze `./logs.txt`: read with `Grep` `head_limit: 30` (last 30 lines; increase if needed — avoid loading the whole file). Write analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. Use the `scout` subagent to locate the exact source of the issue; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → a direct user question → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the fix.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 3.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `$prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=test` — failing-test branch

**Goal:** Run test suites, analyze failures, and fix the underlying code or test issues.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE fixing):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the reported test failure). Map failing-test evidence (before) and passing-test evidence (after) to the saved success criteria in the Iteration Log — a passing suite that misses a saved required criterion does NOT close the loop.

**Key Rules:**

- Distinguish between code bugs and flawed test expectations.
- Re-run tests after the fix to confirm all pass.
- Read `docs/project-reference/integration-test-reference.md` before reviewing/writing integration tests; consult `docs/specs/` for expected-behavior context when diagnosing failures.

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `tester` subagent to compile the code and fix any syntax errors.
2. Use the `tester` subagent to run the tests; report back. Write failure analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{test-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. If tests fail, use the `debugger` subagent to find the root cause; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → a direct user question → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the plan step by step.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `$prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ui` — UI / visual-defect branch

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix UI/UX issues — layout, styling, responsiveness, and visual bugs.

**Key Rules:**

- Always use BEM classes on template elements.
- Check responsive breakpoints when fixing layout issues.
- **Pre-read (design system):** load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so fixes use real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) and canonical component classes — not invented values.

**Required skills (priority order):** `ui-ux-pro-max` (design-intelligence DB) → `web-design-guidelines` (principles) → `frontend-design` (implementation patterns).

**Workflow:**

**FIRST** — run `ui-ux-pro-max` searches to understand context and common issues:

```bash
python $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product-type>" --domain product
python $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<style-keywords>" --domain style
python $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "accessibility" --domain ux
python $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "z-index animation" --domain ux
```

If the user provides screenshots/videos, use the `visual analysis tooling` skill to describe the issue in detail so developers can predict the root causes.

> **🛑 After identifying the UI root cause, present findings + proposed fix → a direct user question → wait for approval before any code change.**

1. Use the `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the fix step by step (against the design guideline — `designSystem.canonicalDoc`).
2. Capture screenshots (at the exact parent container, not the whole page) and analyze with the appropriate Gemini skill (`visual analysis tooling`, `video-analysis`, or `document-extraction`) so the result matches the design guideline and addresses all issues. Repeat until addressed.
3. Use the browser automation tooling to verify the fix matches the design guideline.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to compile and test; report back. Repeat until all tests pass.
5. **If the user approves:** run the `project-manager` and `docs-manager` subagents in parallel to update plan progress and `./docs`; have `project-manager` also create/update a project roadmap at `./docs/project-roadmap.md`.
6. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `$prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

## Workflow:

If user provides screenshots or videos, use `visual analysis tooling` skill to describe issue in detail; ensure developers can predict root causes from description.

### Fulfill the request

**Question Everything:** Use a direct user question tool to ask probing questions to fully understand user's request, constraints, true objectives. Don't assume — clarify until 100% certain.

- Use a direct user question to clarify any open questions.
- Ask 1 question at a time; wait for answer before next question.
- No questions → start next step.

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause + plan creation, MUST ATTENTION present findings + proposed fix plan to user via a direct user question and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.
> **End-to-Start Trace Gate:** For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, stale/incorrect final outputs, or behavior-changing fixes, the root-cause plan MUST ATTENTION include `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and run `$debug-investigate` or `$investigate` before planning code changes.

### Fix the issue

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the reported issue via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`. The saved success criteria define what "fixed" means — a proven local fix that misses a saved required criterion is NOT complete. After proof, append root cause, proof evidence, and remaining goal gaps to the Iteration Log. Tiny fixes may skip deeper gates ONLY with user-accepted reason recorded in the goal file.

Use `sequential-thinking` skill to break complex problems into sequential thought steps.
Use `problem-solving` skills to tackle issues.
Analyze skills catalog and activate other needed skills during the process.

1. Use `debugger` subagent to find root cause and report back to main agent.
   1.5. Write investigation results to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning fix.
   1.6. Confirm the report contains final symptom -> reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/origin, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof.
2. Use `researcher` subagent to research root causes on internet (if needed) and report back.
3. Use `planner` subagent to create implementation plan based on reports; report back.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → a direct user question → wait for user approval.**
5. Use `$plan-execute` SlashCommand to implement plan step by step.
6. Final Report:

- Report back to user with summary of changes; explain briefly; guide user to get started; suggest next steps.
- Ask user whether to commit and push to git; if yes, use `git-manager` subagent.

* **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for concision when writing reports.
* **IMPORTANT:** List unresolved questions at end of reports, if any.

**REMEMBER:**

- Generate images with `visual analysis tooling` skills on the fly for visual assets.
- Read and analyze generated assets with `visual analysis tooling` skills to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use media processing tooling as needed.

- **After fixing, MUST ATTENTION run `$prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

> **Spec-Loop completion gate (canonical: `SYNC:spec-loop-discipline`).** The fix is NOT done until the touched invariants close the loop: (1) every §4 [HARD] rule / §5 invariant the bug violated has a **universally-quantified property TC** ("for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds") + boundary counter-case — not just the single reproduction example (this is the property bar the §3 regression-TC must meet, not merely an example case); (2) the fixed core-logic line is **mutation-killed** — if a mutant survives on the changed line the killing test is missing, so the bug can silently return (MUTATION-SCORE bar, not line-coverage %); (3) the finding fed BOTH the spec and the tests per the §3 spec-correctness decision AND a guarding test (Dual-Feedback) — a code-only patch with neither leaves the disease undocumented. Re-verify spec + tests + code together before declaring the fix complete.

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: after the Minimum Contract completes. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **The Standalone Mode Minimum Contract above is NOT optional and NOT a question** — standalone `$fix` has already auto-run `debug-investigate` → fix spine → `$prove-fix` → conditional `$spec` check → (`$review-changes` for production code) → `$why-review` as the terminal sign-off. Do not re-ask the user whether to do those; they are the guaranteed floor.
>
> **AFTER that floor is met,** MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to offer what lies BEYOND the minimum (user decides):

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Hand off to the best-fit workflow (e.g. `workflow-bugfix`) from here to add the remaining gates the minimum spine omits — `plan-validate`, `integration-test` authoring/review/verify, `production-readiness-review`, `security-review`, `changelog`, `docs-update`.
- **"$test"** — Run the full test suite to verify the fix in context.
- **"Commit & push"** — Hand the proven, reviewed change to the `git-manager` subagent.
- **"Stop here"** — Minimum contract satisfied; user takes it from here.

> If already inside a workflow, skip both the contract and this menu — the workflow sequence handles diagnosis, spec sync, review, and next steps.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace -->

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Eliminate the root cause of an issue — traced end-to-start with `file:line` evidence and fixed at the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site) — then prove the fix with `$prove-fix` so the disease is cured, not just the symptom.

**MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** start at observed final output, trace backward through every feeder path before fixing.
- **Root Cause Debugging:** reproduce → isolate → trace → hypothesize → verify → fix the cause, never symptoms.
- **Nested Task Creation:** parent workflow rows don't replace child phase tracking; expand and link phases.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** read required project-reference docs (`lessons.md` always) before target work.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task tracking; persist plan/review findings to `plans/reports/` incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** cite `file:line` for every claim; <60% confidence = do NOT recommend.
- **Fix-Layer Accountability:** trace full data flow, fix at the owning layer, not the crash site.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** when source behavior changes, decide from evidence whether affected tests change.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace the symptom end-to-start to the invariant-owning layer and fix there — NEVER at the crash site — why: the crash site is a symptom; the bad state enters at a lower layer and one fix there protects all downstream consumers
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim — 95%+ recommend, 80-94% caveats, 60-79% list unknowns, STOP if <60% — why: speculation patches the wrong layer and ships the disease
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix — present root cause + plan via a direct user question and get approval BEFORE any code change (skip ONLY inside a workflow) — why: silent fixes bypass the human gate on irreversible code change
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** route on `--target=` FIRST — each `{ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branch is self-contained (own diagnosis + `$prove-fix`); no flag = full diagnose→fix spine — why: branches must not re-run §1/§2 of the standalone spine
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD (full rigor) — opt out to fast mode ONLY when the bug is genuinely trivial (ALL 5 Default Mode Policy conditions met); when in doubt default hard — why: skipping diagnosis on a non-trivial bug fixes the symptom and leaves the disease
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** standalone (no parent workflow) self-assembles the spine `debug-investigate → fix + prove-fix → $spec correctness check → $review-changes (production code) → $why-review`; inside a workflow SKIP it — why: standalone has no sequence supplying diagnosis, spec sync, or review
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after fixing, run `$prove-fix` — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores; never skip — why: a "should fix it" without a forward convergence proof is unverified
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-loop completion — the fix is NOT done until the violated §4/§5 invariant has a universally-quantified property TC + boundary case, the changed line is mutation-killed, and the finding fed BOTH spec and tests (Dual-Feedback) — why: a code-only patch leaves the bug case undocumented and able to silently return
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos BEFORE starting (one read = one task); call the current task list first on context loss to resume, never duplicate — why: long debug files exhaust context and silently lose findings
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read required project-reference docs (`lessons.md` always; `integration-test-reference.md` for test branch; `docs/specs/` for behavior) before target work — why: project conventions override generic debugging assumptions
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ similar patterns and read existing code before any fix; evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern — why: closest example ≠ matching preconditions
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo to verify work quality, then extract root-cause lessons (`$learn`) if the failure mode would recur without the reminder

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
   **Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
   **Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
