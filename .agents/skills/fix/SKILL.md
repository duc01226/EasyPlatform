> - Prefer the `plan-hard` skill for planning guidance in this Codex mirror.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - User-question prompts mean to ask the user directly in Codex.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, execute each listed child-skill step explicitly and report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.

## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:START -->

> **[BLOCKING]** Execute skill steps in declared order. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval.
> **[BLOCKING]** Before each step or sub-skill call, update task tracking: set `in_progress` when step starts, set `completed` when step ends.
> **[BLOCKING]** Every completed/skipped step MUST include brief evidence or explicit skip reason.
> **[BLOCKING]** If Task tools are unavailable, create and maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with the same status transitions.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:END -->

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **Estimation Framework** — Bottom-up first; SP DERIVED; output min-max range when likely ≥3d. Stack-agnostic. Baseline: 3-5yr dev, 6 productive hrs/day. AI estimate assumes Claude Code + project context.
>
> **Method:**
>
> 1. **Blast Radius pass** (below) — drives code AND test cost
> 2. Decompose phases → hours/phase → `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours`
> 3. `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6) × productivity_factor`
> 4. Sum **Risk Margin** (base + add-ons) → `max_days = likely_days × (1 + margin)`
> 5. `min_days = likely_days × 0.9`
> 6. Output as range when `likely_days ≥3`; single point allowed `<3` (still record margin)

>
> AI default behavior: see error at Place A → fix Place A. This is WRONG. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
>
> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**
>
> 1. **Trace full data flow** — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where the bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
> 2. **Identify the invariant owner** — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? That layer is responsible. Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant — not the highest layer that consumes it.
> 3. **One fix, maximum protection** — Ask: "If I fix here, does it protect ALL downstream consumers with ONE change?" If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
> 4. **Verify no bypass paths** — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for: direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Full data flow traced (origin → crash) `- [ ]` Invariant owner identified with `file:line` evidence `- [ ]` All access sites audited (grep count) `- [ ]` Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers)

>
> - "Fix it where it crashes" — Crash site ≠ cause site. Trace upstream.
> - "Add defensive checks at every consumer" — Scattered defense = wrong layer. One authoritative fix > many scattered guards.

<!-- /SYNC:fix-layer-accountability -->

> **OOM/Memory Fix Triage** — Before jumping to projection or chunking: (1) Is the query unbounded — no DB-level filter for the triggering condition? Push that filter to the DB — eliminates OOM absolutely. (2) Is each row excessively large? Apply projection — reduces severity proportionally. Row count has higher ROI than row size for memory fixes.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze issues and intelligently route to the best-matching specialized fix command (fix-ci, fix-fast, fix-hard, fix-ui, etc.).

**Workflow:**

1. **Check** — Look for existing plan; if found, route to `$code <plan>`
2. **Classify** — Match issue type (type errors, UI, CI, logs, tests, general)
3. **Route** — Delegate to specialized fix variant based on classification

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset is non-negotiable: every claim needs traced proof with `file:line` evidence
- Never assume first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Parent skill for all fix-\* variants; routes based on issue keywords

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

| Simple/obvious fix        | `$fix-fast`         | Skip deep investigation                     |
| Complex/multi-file bug    | `$fix-hard`         | Uses subagents for parallel investigation   |
| Multiple independent bugs | `$fix-parallel`     | Parallel fix execution                      |
| General/unknown           | `$fix` (this skill) | Routes automatically based on keywords      |

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **[ROOT-CAUSE-FIX]** Never patch symptoms. Trace the full call chain to find WHO is responsible. Fix at the correct layer (Entity > Service > Handler). If a fix feels like a workaround, it IS — find the real root cause first.

**Be skeptical. Every claim needs `file:line` traced proof. Confidence >80% to act.**

- NEVER assume first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- MUST ATTENTION include `file:line` evidence for every root cause claim; otherwise state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- ALWAYS trace execution path before claiming cause; ALWAYS check related code paths for contributing factors
- NEVER say "should fix it" without proof the fix addresses the traced root cause
- **Confidence Gate:** `Confidence: X%` required for EVERY claim. **95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

**Analyze issues and route to specialized fix command:**
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Plan Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** — Before routing to ANY fix variant, you MUST ATTENTION have a validated plan. This applies whether running standalone or within a workflow.

**If no plan exists**, you MUST ATTENTION create todo tasks for and execute these steps IN ORDER before proceeding to fix:

1. **`$plan-hard`** — Create an implementation plan for the fix (root cause analysis + fix approach + affected files)
2. **`$plan-review`** — Auto-review the plan for validity, correctness, and best practices
3. **`$plan-validate`** — Validate plan with critical questions interview (get user confirmation)

**Only after plan is validated** → proceed to fix routing below.

**If a plan already exists** (markdown plan file in `plans/`) → skip to fix routing.

## Decision Tree

**1. Check for existing plan:**

- If markdown plan exists → `$code <path-to-plan>`
- If NO plan exists → **STOP. Run `$plan-hard → $plan-review → $plan-validate` first** (see section above)

**2. Route by issue type (only after plan exists):**

**A) Type Errors** (keywords: type, typescript, tsc, type error)
→ `$fix-types`

**B) UI/UX Issues** (keywords: ui, ux, design, layout, style, visual, button, component, css, responsive)
→ `$fix-ui <detailed-description>`

**C) CI/CD Issues** (keywords: github actions, pipeline, ci/cd, workflow, deployment, build failed)
→ `$fix-ci <github-actions-url-or-description>`

**D) Test Failures** (keywords: test, spec, jest, vitest, failing test, test suite)
→ `$fix-test <detailed-description>`

**E) Log Analysis** (keywords: logs, error logs, log file, stack trace)
→ `$fix-logs <detailed-description>`

**F) Multiple Independent Issues** (2+ unrelated issues in different areas)
→ `$fix-parallel <detailed-description>`

**G) Complex Issues** (keywords: complex, architecture, refactor, major, system-wide, multiple components)
→ `$fix-hard <detailed-description>`

**H) Simple/Quick Fixes** (default: small bug, single file, straightforward)
→ `$fix-fast <detailed-description>`

## Graph Intelligence (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP when graph.db exists)

If `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, you MUST ATTENTION use graph to enhance analysis with structural queries:

**Without graph, your fix may miss affected callers, consumers, and tests. This step is NOT optional.**

- **Trace callers of buggy function:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <function> --json`
- **Find existing tests:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query tests_for <function> --json`
- **Batch analysis:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph batch-query file1 file2 --json`

### Graph-Assisted Fix Verification

Before and after fixing, use graph trace to understand blast radius:

1. `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file-to-fix> --direction downstream --json` — see all downstream consumers affected by the fix
2. `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file-to-fix> --direction both --json` — full flow to ensure fix doesn't break upstream or downstream

## MANDATORY: Post-Fix Verification

**After EVERY fix, you MUST ATTENTION run `$prove-fix` to verify correctness.**

`$prove-fix` builds code proof traces (stack-trace-style) per change, assigns confidence percentages, and produces a ship/block verdict. This is non-negotiable — never skip it. If confidence < 80% on any change, return to investigation.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `bugfix` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → debug → plan → plan-review → plan-validate → fix → prove-fix → review → test
> 2. **Execute `$fix` directly** — still requires `$plan-hard → $plan-review → $plan-validate` before fixing (enforced by Plan Before Fix gate above)

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via a direct user question. Skip if inside workflow.)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (fix applied). This ensures prove-fix, review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"$test"** — Run tests to verify fix
- **"$integration-test"** — Generate/update regression integration tests
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

1. **DETECT:** Match prompt against workflow catalog
2. **ANALYZE:** Find best-match workflow AND evaluate if a custom step combination would fit better
3. **ASK (REQUIRED FORMAT):** Use a direct user question with this structure:
    - Question: "Which workflow do you want to activate?"
    - Option 1: "Activate **[BestMatch Workflow]** (Recommended)"
    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
   **[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
   **Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
   **AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
