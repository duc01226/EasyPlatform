## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

# Graph Trace — Full System Flow

Trace connections from a target node through multiple edge types using BFS. Shows the complete chain: API endpoints → commands → entity events → bus messages → cross-service consumers.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Trace full system flow from a target file or function through all edge types (CALLS, events, bus messages, API endpoints). Supports downstream, upstream, or bidirectional tracing. Use when investigating what happens when code executes, understanding blast radius, or tracing frontend-to-backend flows.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## When to Use

- **"What happens when X is called/created/updated?"** → `--direction downstream`
- **"What calls/triggers X?"** → `--direction upstream`
- **"Show me the full flow through X"** → `--direction both` (best when entry point is a middle file like a controller or command handler)
- **Impact analysis** — understand what's affected by a code change
- **Cross-service tracing** — follow MESSAGE_BUS edges to see which services consume events

## Prerequisites

Graph must exist (`.code-graph/graph.db`). If missing, run `$graph-build` first.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the target

If the user specifies a file path, use it directly. If the query is semantic:

1. **Grep first** to find entry point files related to the user's query
2. Use the discovered file as the trace target

### Step 2: Choose direction

| Direction              | When to Use                         | Example                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `downstream` (default) | What does this code trigger?        | "What happens after employee is created?" |
| `upstream`             | What calls this code?               | "What triggers this event handler?"       |
| `both`                 | Full picture through a middle point | "Show full flow through this controller"  |

### Step 3: Run trace

```bash
# Downstream trace (default) — what does this trigger?
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --json

# Upstream trace — what calls/triggers this?
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction upstream --json

# Bidirectional — full flow through this point
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction both --json

# Custom depth (default: 3)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction both --depth 5 --json

# Filter to specific edge types
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --edge-kinds CALLS,MESSAGE_BUS --json
```

### Step 4: Present results

The trace returns a multi-level BFS tree:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "direction": "both",
  "levels": [
    { "depth": 0, "nodes": [...], "edges": [] },
    { "depth": 1, "nodes": [...], "edges": [{ "kind": "CALLS", ... }] },
    { "depth": 2, "nodes": [...], "edges": [{ "kind": "MESSAGE_BUS", ... }] }
  ]
}
```

Present results grouped by depth level. Highlight cross-service MESSAGE_BUS edges — these show the flow spreading to other microservices.

### Step 5: Handle ambiguous targets

If trace returns `status: "ambiguous"`, multiple nodes match the target name. Use `search` to find the exact qualified name:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph search <keyword> --kind Function --json
```

Then retry with the full qualified name.

## Edge Types Traced

| Edge Kind                | Meaning                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `CALLS`                  | Direct function/method calls                     |
| `TRIGGERS_EVENT`         | Entity CRUD triggers event handler               |
| `PRODUCES_EVENT`         | Event handler triggers bus message producer      |
| `MESSAGE_BUS`            | Bus message producer to consumer (cross-service) |
| `TRIGGERS_COMMAND_EVENT` | Command triggers command event handler           |
| `API_ENDPOINT`           | Frontend HTTP call to backend route              |

## CLI Reference

```
trace <target> [--direction downstream|upstream|both] [--depth N] [--edge-kinds KIND1,KIND2] [--node-mode file|function|class|all] [--json]
```

| Flag           | Default      | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--direction`  | `downstream` | Trace direction                                                     |
| `--depth`      | `3`          | Maximum BFS depth                                                   |
| `--edge-kinds` | all          | Comma-separated edge kinds to follow                                |
| `--node-mode`  | `all`        | Granularity: `file` (10-30x less noise), `function`, `class`, `all` |
| `--json`       | off          | Structured JSON output                                              |

## Examples

```bash
# What happens when a user is created? (trace from command handler downstream)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace src/Services/Accounts/Commands/CreateUser/CreateUserCommandHandler.cs --json

# What calls this API controller? (trace upstream to find frontend callers)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace src/Services/Growth/Controllers/GoalController.cs --direction upstream --json

# Full flow through an entity event handler (upstream triggers + downstream consumers)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace src/Services/Employee/UseCaseEvents/EmployeeCreatedEventHandler.cs --direction both --json

# File-level overview (10-30x less noise — great first pass before drilling into functions)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace src/Services/Growth/Controllers/GoalController.cs --direction both --node-mode file --json
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't trace without `--json`** — structured output is needed for parsing
- **Don't trace with depth > 5** — results get noisy; use edge-kinds filter instead
- **Don't skip grep-first** — if you don't know the file path, grep for it first
- **Don't use for single-hop queries** — use `callers_of` or `importers_of` instead (faster)

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
