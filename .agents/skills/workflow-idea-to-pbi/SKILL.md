## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**

- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**

- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

Activate the `idea-to-pbi` workflow. Run `$workflow-start idea-to-pbi` with the user's prompt as context.

**Steps:**
$idea → $review-artifact (conditional) → $handoff (conditional) → $refine → $refine-review → $why-review → $story → $story-review → $tdd-spec → $tdd-spec-review → $pbi-challenge → $dor-gate → $pbi-mockup → $prioritize → $docs-update → $watzup → $workflow-end

> **Conditional steps:**
>
> - `$review-artifact` — skip if no existing artifact/ticket/PRD; proceed straight to `$refine`
> - `$handoff` — skip if no formal PO→BA handoff needed
> - `$pbi-mockup` — skip if PBI is backend-only (no UI changes)

---

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Idea to PBI workflow — capture or review idea/artifact, optional handoff, refine to PBI, validate design rationale, create stories, generate TDD test specs, challenge review, DoR gate, mockup, prioritize.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## When to Use

- PO or BA has a raw idea and needs to shape it into a grooming-ready PBI
- PO is handing off an existing ticket, PRD, or brief to the BA team for refinement
- Single-PBI refinement with stories, test specifications, challenge review, and DoR validation
- Feature needs a structured PBI before entering a sprint

## When NOT to Use

- Multiple opportunities from a discovery sprint → use `product-discovery`
- Full feature lifecycle including implementation → use `full-feature-lifecycle`
- Implementation-only (PBI already exists and is DoR-ready) → use `feature` or `big-feature`
- Bug fixes → use `bugfix`

## Key Mechanics

### 1. Step Selection Gate

After confirming the workflow, present the full step list and let the user deselect irrelevant steps:

```
- [x] Idea capture (idea)
- [ ] Review existing artifact (review-artifact)   — CONDITIONAL
- [ ] PO → BA handoff (handoff)                    — CONDITIONAL
- [x] Refine to PBI (refine)
- [x] PBI review (refine-review)
- [x] Design rationale review (why-review)
- [x] User stories (story)
- [x] Story review (story-review)
- [x] Test specifications (tdd-spec)
- [x] Test specification review (tdd-spec-review)
- [x] Dev BA PIC challenge (pbi-challenge)
- [x] Definition of Ready gate (dor-gate)
- [x] PBI mockup/wireframe (pbi-mockup)            — CONDITIONAL
- [x] Backlog prioritization (prioritize)
- [x] Documentation synchronization (docs-update)
```

Mark skipped steps as completed immediately.

### 2. task tracking Before Starting

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** — Call task tracking for every step before beginning any work:

```
Task tracking: "Idea capture"
Task tracking: "Refine to PBI"
Task tracking: "PBI review (refine-review)"
Task tracking: "Design rationale review (why-review)"
Task tracking: "User stories (story)"
Task tracking: "Story review"
Task tracking: "Test specifications (tdd-spec)"
Task tracking: "Test specification review (tdd-spec-review)"
Task tracking: "Dev BA PIC challenge"
Task tracking: "Definition of Ready gate"
Task tracking: "PBI mockup" [if UI]
Task tracking: "Prioritize"
Task tracking: "Documentation synchronization (docs-update)"
Task tracking: "Session summary (watzup)"
```

One task per step. Mark each completed immediately when done — never batch.

### 3. Why-Review Gate (After refine-review, Before story)

This is the adversarial design rationale check. Purpose: validate the **WHY** of this PBI before investing in stories.

**Challenge prompts:**

- Is this the right solution to the stated problem? What was rejected and why?
- Are the acceptance criteria constraints justified? What happens if any constraint is removed?
- Pre-mortem: if this PBI ships and fails in 3 months, what breaks?
- Are there simpler alternatives not yet considered?
- Does the scope align with the stated business value?

**Output:** Why-Review checklist with PASS / WARN / FAIL.

| Result | Action                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| PASS   | Proceed to `$story`                             |
| WARN   | Document risk, proceed with user acknowledgment |
| FAIL   | Revise PBI in `$refine` before continuing       |

### 4. TDD-Spec Gate (After story-review, Before pbi-challenge)

Generate and review test specifications before challenge and DoR gates so reviewers evaluate a testable PBI.

**Output requirements:**

- Map material acceptance criteria and user stories to TC IDs
- Cover happy path, validation failure, authorization/permission, and important edge cases where applicable
- Run `$tdd-spec-review` before `$pbi-challenge`

### 5. PBI Output Format

Each PBI artifact must contain:

| Section             | Content                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Title               | Clear, actionable                           |
| Problem Statement   | Why this needs to exist                     |
| Hypothesis          | If we build X, users will Y, which drives Z |
| Acceptance Criteria | GIVEN / WHEN / THEN format                  |
| RICE Score          | Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort        |
| User Stories        | Who / What / Why                            |
| Test Specs          | TC IDs mapped to acceptance criteria        |
| DoR Status          | PASS / WARN / FAIL                          |
| Mockup              | ASCII wireframe (if UI)                     |

### 6. Artifact Locations

| Step           | Output Path                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Idea           | `team-artifacts/ideas/{date}-idea-{slug}.md`      |
| PBI            | `team-artifacts/pbis/{date}-pbi-{slug}.md`        |
| Stories        | Added to PBI artifact                             |
| Test specs     | Feature doc Section 15 / `docs/specs/`            |
| DoR result     | Added to PBI artifact                             |
| Mockup         | Added to PBI artifact                             |
| Prioritization | `team-artifacts/backlog/{date}-backlog-update.md` |
| Docs sync      | `plans/reports/docs-update-{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}.md`    |

Write output IMMEDIATELY after each step — never batch across steps.

### 7. Conditional Skip Rules

| Step               | Skip When                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `$review-artifact` | No existing artifact — raw idea input |
| `$handoff`         | No formal PO→BA handoff needed        |
| `$pbi-mockup`      | Backend-only PBI — no UI changes      |

---

### 8. Near-Final Documentation Synchronization

Run `$docs-update` after `$prioritize` and before `$watzup`.

Purpose:

- Sync refined PBI/story outputs into business feature docs where applicable.
- Sync feature doc Section 15 test specifications and `docs/specs/` dashboards after `$tdd-spec-review`.
- Verify specs, feature docs, and TDD/spec docs do not drift before workflow closure.
- Record skipped sub-phases explicitly when no impacted docs exist.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $idea -> $review-artifact -> $handoff -> $refine -> $why-review -> $refine-review -> $why-review -> $story -> $why-review -> $story-review -> $tdd-spec -> $why-review -> $tdd-spec-review -> $pbi-challenge -> $dor-gate -> $pbi-mockup -> $prioritize -> $docs-update -> $watzup -> $workflow-end

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** why-review runs after refine-review — FAIL blocks story writing, WARN requires user acknowledgment
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** tdd-spec and tdd-spec-review run after story-review and before pbi-challenge
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** pbi-challenge must be run by a reviewer different from the drafter

    - Option 2: "Activate custom workflow: **[step1 → step2 → ...]**" (include one-line rationale)
4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons Learned

> **[CRITICAL]** Hard-won project debugging/architecture rules. MUST ATTENTION apply BEFORE forming hypothesis or writing code.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Prevent recurrence of known failure patterns — debugging, architecture, naming, AI orchestration, environment.

**Top Rules (apply always):**

- MUST ATTENTION verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis
- MUST ATTENTION fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom sites with caller-specific defensive code
- MUST ATTENTION use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` for parallel async + repo/UoW — NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`
- MUST ATTENTION name by PURPOSE not CONTENT — adding member forces rename = abstraction broken
- MUST ATTENTION persist sub-agent findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end
- MUST ATTENTION Windows bash: verify Python alias (`where python`/`where py`) — NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves

---

## Debugging & Root Cause Reasoning

- [2026-04-11] **Holistic-first: verify environment before code.** Failure → list ALL preconditions (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI regs, credentials, permissions, data prerequisites) → verify each via evidence (grep/cat/query) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis. Worst rabbit holes: diving nearest layer while bug sits elsewhere — e.g., hours debugging "sync timeout", real cause: test appsettings pointing wrong DB. Cheapest check first.
- [2026-04-01] **Ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace: bug in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling)? Fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site masking real issue.
- [2026-04-01] **Trace data lifecycle, not error site.** Follow data: creation → transformation → consumption. Bug usually where data created wrong, not consumed.
- [2026-04-01] **Code is caller-agnostic.** Functions/handlers/consumers don't know who invokes them. Comments/guards/messages describe business intent — NEVER reference specific callers (tests, seeders, scripts).

## Architecture Invariants

- [2026-03-31] **ParallelAsync + repo/UoW MUST use `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask`.** `ExecuteUowTask` creates new UoW but reuses outer DI scope (same DbContext) — parallel iterations sharing non-thread-safe DbContext silently corrupt data. `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync` creates new UoW + new DI scope (fresh repo per iteration).
- [2026-03-31] **Bus message naming MUST include service name prefix — core services NEVER consume feature events.** Prefix declares schema ownership (`AccountUserEntityEventBusMessage` = Accounts owns). Core services (Accounts, Communication) are leaders. Feature services (Growth, Talents) sending to core MUST use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage` — never define own event for core to consume.

## Naming & Abstraction

- [2026-04-12] **Name PURPOSE not CONTENT — "OrXxx" anti-pattern.** `HrManagerOrHrOrPayrollHrOperationsPolicy` names set members, not what it guards. Add role → rename = broken abstraction. **Rule:** names express DOES/GUARDS, not CONTAINS. **Test:** adding/removing member forces rename? YES = content-driven = bad → rename to purpose (e.g., `HrOperationsAccessPolicy`). **Nuance:** "Or" fine in behavioral idioms (`FirstOrDefault`, `SuccessOrThrow`) — expresses HAPPENS, not membership.

## Environment & Tooling

- [2026-04-20] **Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — verify alias first.** Python may not be in bash PATH under those names. Check: `where python` / `where py`. Prefer `py` (Windows Python Launcher) for one-liners, `node` if JS alternative exists.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** holistic-first: verify ALL preconditions (config, env, DB names, endpoints, DI regs) BEFORE code-layer hypothesis — cheapest check first
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix responsible layer — NEVER patch symptom site; trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling), fix root owner
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** parallel async + repo/UoW → ALWAYS `ExecuteInjectScopedAsync`, NEVER `ExecuteUowTask` (shared DbContext = silent data corruption)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bus message prefix = schema ownership; feature services NEVER define events for core services — use `{CoreServiceName}...RequestBusMessage`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name by PURPOSE — adding/removing member forces rename = broken abstraction
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents MUST write findings after each file/section — NEVER batch all findings into one final write
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Windows bash: NEVER assume `python`/`python3` resolves — run `where python`/`where py` first, use `py` launcher or `node`

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**

1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
   **[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
