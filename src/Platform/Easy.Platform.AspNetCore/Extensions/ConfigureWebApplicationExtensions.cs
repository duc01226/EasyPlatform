/// <summary>
/// Provides extension methods for configuring the ASP.NET Core application pipeline with platform-specific middleware.
/// These extensions establish a standardized middleware pipeline configuration for all BravoSUITE microservices,
/// ensuring consistent request processing, error handling, and monitoring across the platform.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This static class contains extension methods that configure the ASP.NET Core application pipeline with
/// platform-standard middleware components including:
/// - Global exception handling for centralized error processing
/// - Request ID generation for distributed tracing and correlation
/// - Slow request monitoring and performance warnings
/// - Health check endpoints for service monitoring
/// - Platform-specific middleware ordering and configuration
///
/// Key features:
/// - Standardized middleware pipeline configuration across all services
/// - Proper middleware ordering for optimal request processing
/// - Integration with platform logging and monitoring infrastructure
/// - Support for both development and production environment configurations
/// - Consistent error handling and response formatting
/// - Request correlation and tracing capabilities
///
/// Middleware pipeline order:
/// 1. Global exception handler (first to catch all exceptions)
/// 2. Request ID generator (early for request correlation)
/// 3. Slow request warning monitor (performance tracking)
/// 4. Additional platform middleware as needed
/// 5. Application-specific middleware
///
/// These extensions ensure that all platform services follow the same middleware configuration
/// patterns, providing consistent behavior and facilitating debugging and monitoring across
/// the distributed BravoSUITE architecture.
///
/// Usage:
/// These methods are typically called during application configuration in Startup.cs or Program.cs
/// to establish the standard platform middleware pipeline.
/// </remarks>

    /// - Generates a unique ULID-based request ID if not already present
