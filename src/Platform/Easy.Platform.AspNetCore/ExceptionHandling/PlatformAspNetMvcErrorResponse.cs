/// <summary>
/// Represents a standardized error response structure for ASP.NET Core applications in the Easy.Platform.
/// This class provides a consistent format for error responses across all BravoSUITE microservices,
/// ensuring uniform error handling and client experience.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class is part of the platform's global exception handling infrastructure and provides:
/// - Standardized error response format across all platform services
/// - HTTP status code integration for proper REST API compliance
/// - Request correlation through request ID tracking
/// - Structured error information through PlatformAspNetMvcErrorInfo
/// - JSON serialization support for API responses
///
/// The error response structure includes:
/// - Detailed error information (message, code, validation details)
/// - HTTP status code for proper client handling
/// - Request ID for tracing and correlation across distributed systems
///
/// This format ensures that all platform services return consistent error responses,
/// making it easier for clients to handle errors uniformly regardless of which
/// microservice they're interacting with.
///
/// Usage:
/// This class is typically instantiated by the PlatformGlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware
/// when formatting exception responses, but can also be used by controllers or
/// other components that need to return standardized error responses.
/// </remarks>
