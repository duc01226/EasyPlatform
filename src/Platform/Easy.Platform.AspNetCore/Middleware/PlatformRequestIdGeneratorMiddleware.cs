/// <summary>
/// Middleware that generates and manages unique request identifiers for HTTP requests.
/// This middleware ensures that every incoming HTTP request has a unique identifier that can be used
/// for logging, tracing, and correlation across distributed systems. Should be added at the first middleware
/// or second after UseGlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This middleware is a core component of the Easy.Platform ASP.NET Core infrastructure and provides:
/// - Automatic request ID generation using ULID format for requests without existing IDs
/// - Request ID preservation for requests that already have IDs (for distributed tracing)
/// - Integration with ASP.NET Core's HttpContext.TraceIdentifier for framework integration
/// - Automatic inclusion of request IDs in response headers for client-side tracking
/// - Integration with platform's application request context for cross-service correlation
///
/// The request ID is essential for:
/// - Distributed tracing across microservices in the BravoSUITE platform
/// - Correlation of logs across different services and components
/// - Debugging and troubleshooting in production environments
/// - Performance monitoring and request tracking
///
/// Processing flow:
/// 1. Check if incoming request has a request ID header
/// 2. Generate new ULID-based request ID if not present
/// 3. Set HttpContext.TraceIdentifier to the request ID
/// 4. Store request ID in platform application context
/// 5. Add request ID to response headers for client tracking
/// 6. Continue to next middleware in pipeline
///
/// This middleware will add a generated ULID request ID into headers and should be positioned early
/// in the middleware pipeline for proper request correlation throughout the application lifecycle.
/// </remarks>
