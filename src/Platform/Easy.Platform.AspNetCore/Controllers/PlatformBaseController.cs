/// <summary>
/// Abstract base controller that provides common functionality and dependencies for all API controllers
/// in the Easy.Platform ASP.NET Core infrastructure. This controller establishes a standardized foundation
/// for all BravoSUITE microservice controllers with essential platform services and patterns.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This abstract controller serves as the foundation for all API controllers across the BravoSUITE platform
/// and provides access to core platform services including:
/// - CQRS pattern implementation for command and query separation
/// - Caching infrastructure for performance optimization
/// - Configuration access for application settings
/// - Request context for correlation and distributed tracing
/// - Standardized dependency injection patterns
///
/// Key architectural benefits:
/// - Consistent service access patterns across all controllers
/// - Centralized dependency management for platform services
/// - Standardized request context handling for distributed systems
/// - Built-in caching capabilities for improved performance
/// - CQRS pattern enforcement for clean architecture
/// - Configuration access following platform conventions
///
/// Core dependencies provided:
/// - IPlatformCqrs: Command and query execution with validation and logging
/// - IPlatformCacheRepositoryProvider: Distributed caching for data and responses
/// - IConfiguration: Application configuration and environment settings
/// - IPlatformApplicationRequestContextAccessor: Request-scoped context and correlation
///
/// Usage patterns:
/// All API controllers in BravoSUITE microservices should inherit from this base class
/// to ensure consistent access to platform services and adherence to architectural patterns.
/// Controllers can focus on HTTP-specific concerns while leveraging the platform's
/// infrastructure through the provided dependencies.
///
/// This base controller is widely used across the platform in services including:
/// - Accounts service for user management APIs
/// - bravoTALENTS for talent management endpoints
/// - CandidateApp for candidate-facing APIs
/// - bravoSURVEYS for survey and assessment APIs
/// - And many other BravoSUITE microservices
///
/// The controller follows the platform's dependency injection patterns and provides
/// a consistent foundation for implementing REST APIs with proper separation of concerns.
