/// <summary>
/// Manages a set of lazy-load request context accessors for deferred, asynchronous context value resolution.
/// This class serves as the runtime coordinator for lazy-loaded context values registered through

/// <strong>Core Functionality:</strong>
/// This class bridges the gap between the factory functions defined in application modules and the actual
/// runtime resolution of context values. It manages the lifecycle of lazy-loaded context data using
/// <c>AsyncLocal&lt;T&gt;</c> for thread-safe, request-scoped caching that flows correctly across async/await boundaries.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <strong>Threading and Isolation:</strong>
/// Uses <c>AsyncLocal&lt;LazyLoadRequestContextHolder&gt;</c> to ensure each request thread and its async continuations
/// have isolated context data. This prevents data leakage between concurrent requests while maintaining
/// context flow across async operations within the same logical request.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <strong>Lazy Execution Pattern:</strong>
/// Context values are created using <c>Lazy&lt;object&gt;</c> wrappers that invoke the original async factory functions.
/// This ensures that expensive operations (database queries, API calls, complex calculations) are deferred
/// until the context value is actually needed and then cached for subsequent accesses within the same request.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <strong>Integration with Platform Architecture:</strong>
/// - **Registration:** Receives factory functions from <c>LazyLoadRequestContextAccessorRegistersFactory()</c>
/// - **Resolution:** Converts async factories into lazy synchronous accessors for easier consumption
/// - **Caching:** Maintains request-scoped cache that automatically cleans up when request completes
/// - **Access:** Provides context values through extension methods like <c>RequestContext.CurrentEmployee()</c>
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <strong>Memory Management:</strong>
/// Context data is automatically garbage collected when the request completes, as the <c>AsyncLocal</c>
/// reference goes out of scope. This prevents memory leaks in long-running applications with many requests.
/// </para>
