> **[IMPORTANT]** NEVER change external behavior while simplifying. Read every file before modifying it. Verify no tests break after each change.
> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence (>80% to act, <80% verify first). NEVER fabricate file paths or behavior.
> **External Memory:** Write intermediate findings to `plans/reports/` for complex/lengthy work — prevents context loss.

> 3. `Thought N/M [BRANCH A from Thought K]: ...` — explore alternative; converge with decision rationale
> 4. `Thought N/M [HYPOTHESIS]: ...` then `[VERIFICATION]: ...` — test before acting
> 5. `Thought N/N [FINAL]` — only when verified, all critical aspects addressed, confidence >80%
>
> **Mandatory closers:** Confidence % stated · Assumptions listed · Open questions surfaced · Next action concrete.
>
> **Stop conditions:** confidence <80% on any critical decision → escalate via AskUserQuestion · ≥3 revisions on same thought → re-frame the problem · branch count >3 → split into sub-task.
>
> **Implicit mode:** apply methodology internally without visible markers when adding markers would clutter the response (routine work where reasoning aids accuracy).

Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc.

If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `/sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`.

> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**

> 1. **Trace full data flow** — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where the bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Simplify and refine code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify targets** — Get recently modified files or specified targets
2. **Analyze complexity** — Find nesting, duplication, long methods
3. **Plan changes** — List specific simplifications
4. **Apply incrementally** — One refactoring at a time
5. **Verify functionality** — Run related tests

**Key Rules:**

- NEVER change external behavior
- NEVER remove functionality
- NEVER simplify code you have not read first
- ALWAYS preserve test coverage
- PREFER project patterns over custom solutions
- SKIP generated code, migrations, vendor files

## Project Context

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Read the following project-specific reference docs:
> (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)
>
> - `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md` — validation fluent API, DTO mapping patterns
> - `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component hierarchy, stores, subscription patterns
> - `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS conventions
>
> If files not found, search for: `AppBaseComponent`, store base classes, validation fluent API patterns.

## Simplification Techniques

### 1. Reduce Nesting

```csharp
// Before: Deep nesting
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        if (condition3) { /* logic */ }
    }
}

// After: Guard clauses
if (!condition1) return;
if (!condition2) return;
if (!condition3) return;
// logic
```

### 2. Extract Methods

- Break methods > 20 lines into focused units
- Each method does ONE thing
- Name describes the action

### 3. Simplify Conditionals

- Use guard clauses for early returns
- Replace nested ternaries with if/else or switch
- Extract complex conditions to named booleans

### 4. Remove Duplication (DRY) & Design Pattern Assessment

| Pattern               | When to Recommend                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Base class extraction | Classes with same suffix (*Entity, *Dto, \*Service) |
| Strategy              | Long switch/if-else on type                         |
| Factory               | Scattered `new ConcreteClass()`                     |
| Guard                 | Only recommend with evidence of 3+ occurrences      |

Flag anti-patterns: God Object (>500 lines), Copy-Paste (3+ similar blocks), Circular Dependencies.

### 5. Improve Naming

- Self-documenting code using domain terminology
- Boolean names: `is`, `has`, `can`, `should` prefix

## Project Patterns

### Backend

Apply per `backend-patterns-reference.md`:

- Extract query logic to the project's documented expression / specification helpers
- Use the project's documented fluent / pipeline helpers where they replace imperative chains
- Move DTO mapping to the project's documented mapping convention
- Replace manual validation with the project's documented validation pattern (fluent API, validators, result types)

### Frontend

Apply per `frontend-patterns-reference.md` and `scss-styling-guide.md`:

- Use the project's documented state primitive for complex state
- Apply the project's documented subscription / effect / listener teardown pattern
- Extend the project's documented base components / hooks / composables
- Follow the project's documented class-naming methodology (BEM, utility-first, CSS modules, etc.)

## Output
