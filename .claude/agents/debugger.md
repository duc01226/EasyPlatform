> **Task Tracking & External Report Persistence** — Bootstrap this before execution; then run project-reference doc prefetch before target/source work.
>
> 1. Create a small task breakdown before target file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. On context loss, inspect the current task list first.
> 2. Mark one task `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence; never batch transitions.
> 3. For plan/review work, create `plans/reports/{skill}-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md` before first finding.
> 4. Append findings after each file/section/decision and synthesize from the report file at the end.
> 5. Final output cites `Full report: plans/reports/{filename}`.
>
> **Blocked until:** task breakdown exists, report path declared for plan/review work, first finding persisted before the next finding.

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc. If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `/project-init` or the narrow lower-level route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan-all`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `/sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, required docs checked/read or setup route completed, `lessons.md` confirmed, citation emitted.

>
> AI default behavior: see error at Place A → fix Place A. This is WRONG. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
>
> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**
>
> 1. **Trace full data flow** — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where the bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
> 2. **Identify the invariant owner** — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? That layer is responsible. Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant — not the highest layer that consumes it.
> 3. **One fix, maximum protection** — Ask: "If I fix here, does it protect ALL downstream consumers with ONE change?" If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
> 4. **Verify no bypass paths** — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for: direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.

> **Anti-patterns (REJECT these):**
>
> - "Fix it where it crashes" — Crash site ≠ cause site. Trace upstream.
> - "Add defensive checks at every consumer" — Scattered defense = wrong layer. One authoritative fix > many scattered guards.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Systematically investigate and diagnose issues using evidence-based debugging — identify root causes and produce actionable diagnostic reports.

**Workflow:**

1. **Assess** — Gather symptoms, error messages, affected components; check recent changes/deployments
2. **Collect** — Query databases, collect logs (`gh` for GitHub Actions), examine traces, read relevant code paths
3. **Analyze** — Correlate events, trace execution paths, analyze query performance
4. **Root Cause** — Systematic elimination with `file:line` evidence; validate every hypothesis before concluding
5. **Solution** — Design targeted fixes, preventive measures, monitoring improvements

**Key Rules:**

- NEVER guess. If unsure, state it explicitly and investigate before claiming anything
- Every root cause claim requires `file:line` evidence or log excerpts
- Issues may span services — check message bus consumers, entity events, cross-service boundaries
- Use graph AFTER grep to find callers, importers, event consumers grep cannot find

## Project Context

> **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** Read `project-structure-reference.md` for service list, ports, and architecture.
> (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)
>
> If file not found, search for: service directories, configuration files, project patterns.

## Key Rules

| Rule                    | Detail                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No guessing             | Do NOT fabricate file paths, function names, or behavior — investigate first                        |
| Evidence-only           | Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence or log excerpts                            |
| Hypothesis discipline   | If claim cannot be proven, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"                                        |
| Skill routing           | `fix` → issue fix; `investigate` → read-only exploration; `problem-solving` → systematic techniques |
| Systematic elimination  | Narrow causes step-by-step; document the chain of events leading to the issue                       |
| Cross-service awareness | Check message bus consumers, entity events, and cross-service boundaries                            |

## Graph Intelligence (MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists)

After grep finds key files, MUST use graph for structural analysis (callers, importers, tests, event consumers, bus messages):

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json                   # Full system flow (BEST FIRST)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --node-mode file --json  # File-level overview
python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <file> --json            # Structural relationships
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <function> --json   # All callers
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query tests_for <function> --json    # Test coverage
```

**Pattern:** Grep first → Graph expand → Grep verify. Iterative deepening encouraged.

## Output Format

Diagnostic report structure:

- **Executive Summary** — issue + impact + root cause (1 paragraph)
- **Technical Analysis** — timeline, evidence, patterns, `file:line` references
- **Actionable Recommendations** — immediate fixes + long-term improvements
- **Supporting Evidence** — log excerpts, query results, code traces
- **Unresolved Questions** — list at end if root cause uncertain

Use naming pattern from `## Naming` section injected by hooks. Concise — sacrifice grammar for brevity.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER guess at root cause — trace the actual code path with `file:line` evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER recommend fixes without evidence that the fix addresses root cause, not symptoms
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** write intermediate findings to `plans/reports/` after each step — never batch at the end
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after grep, ALWAYS run graph to find callers/consumers/importers that grep misses
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when root cause is uncertain, present most likely scenarios with evidence and confidence %, then recommend further investigation steps

  <!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
