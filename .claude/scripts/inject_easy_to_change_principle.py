"""One-shot injector for the "First Principle — Easy to Change" block.

Inserts the canonical principle block into a fixed list of SKILL.md files
(weaving it as a new H2 section IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the file's existing
principles/mindset/rules anchor heading) and appends the closing reminder at
end-of-file. Idempotent: skips files that already contain the marker.

Usage:
    python .claude/scripts/inject_easy_to_change_principle.py [--dry-run]

Designed to be deleted after one successful run.

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, a refactor, a test, or an abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated design that
  isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.
