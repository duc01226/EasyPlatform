  description: Process and generate multimedia content using Google Gemini API for
    better vision capabilities. Capabilities include analyze audio files (transcription
    with timestamps, summarization, speech understanding, music/sound analysis up
    to 9.5 hours), understand images (better image analysis than Claude models, captioning,
    reasoning, object detection, design extraction, OCR, visual Q&A, segmentation,
    handle multiple images), process videos (scene detection, Q&A, temporal analysis,
    YouTube URLs, up to 6 hours), extract from documents (PDF tables, forms, charts,
    diagrams, multi-page), generate images (text-to-image with Imagen 4, editing,
    composition, refinement), generate videos (text-to-video with Veo 3, 8-second
    clips with native audio). Use when working with audio/video files, analyzing images
    or screenshots (instead of default vision capabilities of Claude, only fallback
    to Claude's vision capabilities if needed), processing PDF documents, extracting
    structured data from media, creating images/videos from text prompts, or implementing
    multimodal AI features. Supports Gemini 3/2.5, Imagen 4, and Veo 3 models with
    context windows up to 2M tokens.
