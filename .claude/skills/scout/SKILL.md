## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Deliver a complete, prioritized map of every file relevant to the task via fast, parallel codebase discovery — grep + graph combined — so downstream work starts with full coverage and zero blind spots.

**Summary:**

- Classify scope FIRST (Phase 0: backend/frontend/full-stack) so you spawn only the agents you need — never the default 3 when the prompt names one layer.
- Sub-agents do the parallel grep/glob; only YOU (main agent) run the graph commands afterward — graph expansion on 2-3 key files is MANDATORY when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists and is the step that finds what grep can't.
- This is discovery, not analysis: return prioritized file paths fast (3-5 min), no content deep-dives — that's `investigate`'s job.
- If <5 files surface, re-examine keywords and run a second pass with broader synonyms before synthesizing.

**Workflow:**

1. **Phase 0: Classify** — Detect search scope (backend/frontend/both) + keyword type
2. **Analyze Request** — Extract entity names, feature keywords, file types from prompt
3. **Parallel Search** — Spawn agents searching backend core, backend infra, frontend paths
4. **Graph Expand (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)** — **MUST ATTENTION** run graph commands on 2-3 key files. Graph reveals complete dependency network grep CANNOT find.
5. **Low-Result Check** — If <5 files returned, re-examine keywords and run second pass
6. **Synthesize** — Combine grep + graph into numbered, prioritized file list

**Key Rules:**

- Speed over depth — return file paths only, no content analysis
- Target 3-5 minutes total; 3-minute timeout per agent
- NEVER skip graph expansion when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
- `--ext` / `--engine=external` switches the search engine to the `scout-external` agent (gemini/opencode CLIs); default is internal subagents

## Phase 0: Classify Search Scope

**Before spawning agents**, classify request:

| Scope         | Detection                                              | Agent Strategy           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Backend-only  | server-side class names, domain entities, API handlers | Agents 1+2, skip Agent 3 |
| Frontend-only | component names, client-side source, UI features       | Agent 3 only             |
| Full-stack    | Feature name spanning both layers                      | All 3 agents             |
| Unknown       | Ambiguous prompt                                       | Default all 3 agents     |

**Think:** Prompt mention specific layer? Entity exist in backend, frontend, or both? Adjust agent count — avoid spawning unnecessary agents.

## When to Use

- Quickly locating relevant files across large codebase
- Beginning work on features spanning multiple directories
- Before changes affecting multiple parts
- Mapping file landscape before investigation or implementation

**NOT for:** Deep code analysis (use `investigate`), debugging (use `debug-investigate`), implementation (use `workflow-feature`).

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Search Request

Extract from USER_PROMPT:

- Entity names (User, Customer, Order)
- Feature names (authentication, notification)
- File types needed (backend, frontend, or both)

### Step 2: Execute Parallel Search

Spawn SCALE number of `scout` subagents in parallel via Agent tool (`subagent_type: "scout"`).

**WHY `scout` not `Explore`:** Custom `scout` agents read `.claude/agents/scout.md` — includes graph CLI knowledge + Bash access. Built-in `Explore` agents have NO graph awareness.

#### Engine Selection (`--ext` / `--engine=external`)

Detect the engine flag in args (default: **internal**):

- **Internal (default):** spawn `subagent_type: "scout"` — the parallel grep/glob/graph search described below.
- **External (`--ext` or `--engine=external`):** spawn `subagent_type: "scout-external"` instead. That agent (`.claude/agents/scout-external.md`) owns the `gemini`/`opencode` CLI dispatch, the Explore fallback, and the install prompt when those CLIs are absent.

Flag only switches **which subagent runs**. Orchestration identical for both engines: Phase 0 classify, Step 3 graph-expand (run by you, main agent), low-result check, synthesize. Output contract (numbered, prioritized file list) same.

#### Agent Distribution

- **Agent 1 - Backend Core**: `{module-source-root}/` domain folder + command folder + query folder (per the project's structure reference)
- **Agent 2 - Backend Infra**: `{module-source-root}/` event-handler folder + controllers + background-jobs folder (per the project's structure reference)
- **Agent 3 - Frontend**: `{frontend-apps-dir}/`, `{frontend-libs-dir}/{domain-lib}/`, `{frontend-libs-dir}/{common-lib}/`

Per agent: 3-minute timeout. Return file paths only — no content analysis. Use Glob (patterns), Grep (content), Bash (graph CLI).

### Step 3: Graph Expand (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

**YOU (main agent) MUST ATTENTION run graph commands YOURSELF after sub-agents return.** NOT optional — without graph, results are incomplete. Sub-agents cannot use graph — only main agent can.

```bash
# Check graph exists
ls .code-graph/graph.db 2>/dev/null && echo "GRAPH_AVAILABLE" || echo "NO_GRAPH"
```

If GRAPH_AVAILABLE, pick 2-3 key files from sub-agent results (entities, commands, bus messages):

```bash
# Full dependency network of key file
python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <key_file> --json

# All callers of key command/handler
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <FunctionName> --json

# All importers of bus message class
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <file_path> --json

# Batch query multiple files (most efficient)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph batch-query <file1> <file2> <file3> --json

# If graph returns "ambiguous" — disambiguate first
python .claude/scripts/code_graph search <keyword> --kind Function --json

# Trace shortest path between two nodes
python .claude/scripts/code_graph find-path <source_qn> <target_qn> --json

# Filter by service, limit results
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <name> --limit 5 --filter "ServiceName" --json
```

**Grep-First Discovery (semantic queries):** When prompt describes behavior/flow (not specific file), grep key terms FIRST to discover entry files, then use those as graph input:

1. Grep class names, commands, handlers, endpoints
2. Use discovered files as input to `connections`, `batch-query`, or `trace`
3. Use `trace --direction both` on middle files (controllers, commands) for full upstream + downstream

Graph results get HIGHER priority than grep — structural relationships > text matches. After graph expansion, grep again to verify content in discovered files.

**Post-Grep Trace Trigger:** whenever a grep/glob surfaces an important entry-point file — an entity, command, query, event/command handler, controller, bus message/consumer, component, store, or api-service — immediately run a graph trace on it before concluding. The trace reveals callers, consumers, bus messages, event chains, and tests that grep CANNOT find: `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <key-entry-file> --direction both --json`. **Pattern: grep finds files → graph trace reveals full system flow → grep verifies specific details.**

### Step 4: Low-Result Check

If total files found <5 after Steps 2-3:

1. Re-examine keywords — too specific? Try broader synonyms
2. Spawn second scout agent with alternate search terms
3. Try `python .claude/scripts/code_graph search <keyword> --json` to find nodes by name

### Step 5: Synthesize Results

Combine grep + graph into numbered, prioritized file list (see Results Format).

## Results Format

```markdown
## Scout Results: {USER_PROMPT}

### High Priority - Core Logic

1. `{module-source-root}/{entity-folder}/{Entity}` — domain entity
2. `{module-source-root}/{command-folder}/{Feature}/Save{Entity}Command` — mutating command
   ...

### Medium Priority - Infrastructure

10. `{module-source-root}/{controllers-folder}/{Entity}Controller` — endpoint
11. `{module-source-root}/{event-handler-folder}/{Feature}/SendNotificationOn{Entity}CreatedEventHandler` — event handler
    ...

### Low Priority - Supporting

20. `{module-source-root}/{helpers-folder}/{Entity}Helper` — supporting helper
    ...

### Frontend Files

30. `{frontend-libs-dir}/{domain-lib}/{configured-feature-path}/{feature}-list.component`
    ...

**Total Files Found:** {count}
**Search Completed In:** {time}

### Suggested Starting Points

1. `{most relevant file}` - {reason}
2. `{second most relevant}` - {reason}

### End-to-Start Trace Candidates

| Role                           | Candidate files | Why relevant                                           | Evidence                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Observed final output / reader | `{files}`       | `{reader, renderer, assertion, query, aggregate, log}` | `{file:line or search evidence}` |
| Storage / projection / cache   | `{files}`       | `{state consumed by reader}`                           | `{file:line or search evidence}` |
| Writer / updater               | `{files}`       | `{writes final state}`                                 | `{file:line or search evidence}` |
| Consumer / handler / job       | `{files}`       | `{transforms or schedules writes}`                     | `{file:line or search evidence}` |
| Producer / origin trigger      | `{files}`       | `{upstream source of input}`                           | `{file:line or search evidence}` |

**Feeder-path scan:** list every producer/caller/event/job candidate that may write the same final state. Mark unknown paths explicitly instead of hiding them.

| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**      | Complete in 3-5 minutes                |
| **Accuracy**   | Return only relevant files             |
| **Coverage**   | Search all likely directories          |
| **Efficiency** | Minimize tool calls                    |
| **Structure**  | Always use numbered, prioritized lists |

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If NOT already in workflow, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask user:
>
> 1. **Activate `investigation` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate
> 2. **Execute `/scout` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present:

- **"/investigate (Recommended)"** — Deep-dive into discovered files
- **"/plan"** — If scouted files sufficient to start planning
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings incrementally to `plans/reports/`. Prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, recommendation requires `file:line` proof with confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

<!-- SYNC:graph-assisted-investigation -->

> **Graph-Assisted Investigation** — MANDATORY when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists.
>
> **HARD-GATE:** MUST ATTENTION run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
>
> **Pattern:** Grep finds files → `trace --direction both` reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details
>
> | Task                | Minimum Graph Action                         |
> | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
> | Investigation/Scout | `trace --direction both` on 2-3 entry files  |
> | Fix/Debug           | `callers_of` on buggy function + `tests_for` |
> | Feature/Enhancement | `connections` on files to be modified        |
> | Code Review         | `tests_for` on changed functions             |
> | Blast Radius        | `trace --direction downstream`               |
>
> **CLI:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json`. Use `--node-mode file` first (10-30x less noise), then `--node-mode function` for detail.

> 3. Read every required doc.

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Deliver a complete, prioritized map of every file relevant to the task — grep + graph combined — so downstream work starts with full coverage and zero blind spots.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **Graph-Assisted Investigation:** Run one graph command on key files before concluding.
- **Incremental Persistence:** Append findings to a report file, never hold in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Sub-agents return summary only, full report on disk.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases and link parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs:** Read required project docs before target work; cite them.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking, persist plan findings incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Evidence:** Cite `file:line`; speculation forbidden, <60% do not recommend.
- **Cross-Service Check:** Scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts for silent regressions.
- **Rationalization Prevention:** Reject step-skipping evasions; show grep evidence.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**MUST ATTENTION** every protocol above is in force for this scout — honor its canonical body, not just the digest line.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run Phase 0 classification BEFORE spawning agents — scope (backend/frontend/full-stack) determines agent count; never spawn the default 3 when the prompt names one layer — why: extra agents waste budget and dilute focus
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** graph expand is the MANDATORY step that finds what grep cannot — run at least ONE graph command (`connections`/`callers_of`/`trace --direction both`) on 2-3 key files when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists; NEVER skip it — why: structural relationships > text matches, and sub-agents cannot run graph — only you can
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = DO NOT recommend — why: speculation seeds blind spots downstream work inherits
**MUST ATTENTION** stay in DISCOVERY lane — return prioritized file paths fast (3-5 min), no content deep-dives; that is `investigate`'s job — why: scope creep into analysis breaks the 3-5 min budget and duplicates the next step
**MUST ATTENTION** if <5 files found, re-examine keywords and run a second pass with broader synonyms BEFORE synthesizing — why: a thin result is an under-searched result, not a small surface
**MUST ATTENTION** run a post-grep graph trace whenever grep surfaces an entry-point file (entity, command, query, handler, controller, bus message, component, store, api-service) — trace reveals callers/consumers/event chains/tests grep cannot find — why: missing a downstream consumer = silent regression for the next step
**MUST ATTENTION** spawn `scout`/`scout-external` subagents — NOT built-in `Explore` — why: only the custom agents carry graph CLI knowledge + Bash access
**MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents return a SUMMARY only (≤10 finding bullets + `Full report:` path), writing full findings incrementally to `plans/reports/` — NEVER hold all results in memory or request full sub-agent output inline — why: context cutoff mid-run loses every in-memory finding; disk writes survive compaction
**MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap task tracking BEFORE target work — `TaskList` first on context loss, one task `in_progress` at a time, expand child phases when nested under a workflow row — why: compaction wipes prior-work memory; resume from state, never duplicate
**MUST ATTENTION** read required project-reference docs (always `lessons.md`; `domain-entities-reference.md` for business entities) BEFORE searching — project conventions override generic framework assumptions
**MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` after completing (investigation workflow vs standalone, then /investigate vs /plan vs skip) — NEVER auto-proceed to the next step — why: the user owns scope; assuming standalone skips the workflow they wanted
**MUST ATTENTION** for non-trivial bug/regression scouts, surface End-to-Start trace candidates (reader → storage → writer → consumer → producer) and enumerate every feeder path — why: starting at the first suspicious file collapses multiple producers into one false "flow"

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                | Rebuttal                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Graph step too slow, skip it"         | Graph finds what 50 greps miss. NEVER skip when `graph.db` exists.          |
| "Only 2 files, no need for report"     | Incremental write costs nothing. Skip = context loss risk.                  |
| "Scope obvious, skip Phase 0"          | Wrong agent set = missed files. Classify scope first, every time.           |
| "Already searched, results complete"   | Show grep + graph evidence with `file:line`. No proof = incomplete.         |
| "Use Explore, it's a built-in"         | Explore has NO graph awareness. Spawn `scout`/`scout-external` only.        |
| "<5 files, surface is just small"      | Thin result = under-searched. Broaden synonyms and re-pass before synth.    |
| "I'll deep-dive these files now"       | Discovery only — paths fast, no analysis. Deep-dive is `investigate`'s job. |
| "Simple scout, skip workflow question" | User decides scope. NEVER assume standalone is acceptable.                  |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Phase 0 classify first · graph expand is MANDATORY (never skip when `graph.db` exists) · cite `file:line` with confidence >80% — these three survive any long context, anchored top and bottom.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
