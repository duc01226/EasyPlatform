description: '[Implementation] Implement a feature automatically (trust me bro)'
activation: user-invoked

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before executing.

> **Skill Variant:** Variant of `/cook` — autonomous execution without user confirmation.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Implement features autonomously without stopping for user confirmation at each step.

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyze** — Understand task requirements from arguments
2. **Plan & Execute** — Create plan and implement directly
3. **Verify** — Run tests and review changes

**Key Rules:**
- Autonomous mode: proceed without asking for confirmation
- Still follow all coding standards and patterns
- Break work into todo tasks; add final self-review task

**Ultrathink** to plan & start working on these tasks follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules:
<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the list of skills at `.claude/skills/*` and intelligently activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.**

## Workflow:

1. Trigger slash command `/plan <detailed-instruction-prompt>` to create an implementation plan based on the given tasks.
    - **External Memory**: Ensure `/plan` writes analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/`. Re-read before `/code`.
2. Trigger slash command `/code <plan>` to implement the plan.
3. Finally use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask user if he wants to commit to git repository, if yes trigger `/commit` slash command to create a commit.

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
