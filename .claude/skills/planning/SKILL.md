> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before executing.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create detailed technical implementation plans through research, codebase analysis, solution design, and comprehensive documentation (includes research phase merged from `research` skill).

**Workflow:**

1. **Research** — Parallel researcher agents, sequential-thinking, docs-seeker, GitHub analysis (max 5 researches)
2. **Design Context** — Extract Figma specs if URLs present in source artifacts
3. **Codebase Understanding** — Parallel scout agents, read essential docs (development-rules.md, codebase-summary.md, code-standards.md)
4. **Solution Design** — Trade-off analysis, security, performance, edge cases, architecture
5. **Plan Creation** — YAML frontmatter plan.md + detailed phase-XX-\*.md files
6. **Review** — Run `/plan-review` to validate, ask user to confirm

**Key Rules:**

- **DO NOT** implement code - only create plans
- **DO NOT** use EnterPlanMode tool - already in planning workflow
- **ALWAYS** run `/plan-review` after plan creation
- **COLLABORATE**: Ask decision questions, present options with recommendations

# Planning

Create detailed technical implementation plans through research, codebase analysis, solution design, and comprehensive documentation.

> **Note:** This skill includes the research phase (merged from `research` skill). Use for comprehensive planning that requires investigation before implementation.

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the `EnterPlanMode` tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS run `/plan-review` to validate the plan.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Researching or investigating solutions
- Analyzing approaches and alternatives
- Planning new feature implementations
- Architecting system designs
- Evaluating technical approaches
- Creating implementation roadmaps
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Assessing technical trade-offs

## Disambiguation

- For quick bug triage and systematic debugging, use `debug` instead
- This skill focuses on upfront planning and research before implementation

## Core Responsibilities & Rules

Always honoring **YAGNI**, **KISS**, and **DRY** principles.
**Be honest, be brutal, straight to the point, and be concise.**

### 1. Research & Analysis (**Skip if:** Provided with researcher reports)

> _Content sourced from `references/research-phase.md`_

#### Core Activities

##### Parallel Researcher Agents

- Spawn multiple `researcher` agents in parallel to investigate different approaches
- Wait for all researcher agents to report back before proceeding
- Each researcher investigates a specific aspect or approach

##### Sequential Thinking

- Use `sequential-thinking` skill for dynamic and reflective problem-solving
- Structured thinking process for complex analysis
- Enables multi-step reasoning with revision capability

##### Documentation Research

- Use `docs-seeker` skill to read and understand documentation
- Research plugins, packages, and frameworks
- Find latest technical documentation using llms.txt standard

##### GitHub Analysis

- Use `gh` command to read and analyze:
    - GitHub Actions logs
    - Pull requests
    - Issues and discussions
- Extract relevant technical context from GitHub resources

##### Remote Repository Analysis

When given GitHub repository URL, generate fresh codebase summary:

```bash
# usage:
repomix --remote <github-repo-url>
# example:
repomix --remote https://github.com/mrgoonie/human-mcp
```

##### Debugger Delegation

- Delegate to `debugger` agent for root cause analysis
- Use when investigating complex issues or bugs
- Debugger agent specializes in diagnostic tasks

#### Search Strategy

##### Primary: Gemini CLI

Check if `gemini` bash command is available:

```bash
gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash -p "...your search prompt..."
# Timeout: 10 minutes
```

Save output using `Report:` path from `## Naming` section (include all citations).

##### Fallback: WebSearch Tool

If gemini unavailable, use `WebSearch` tool. Run multiple searches in parallel.

##### Query Crafting

- Craft precise search queries with relevant keywords
- Include terms like "best practices", "2024", "latest", "security", "performance"
- Search for official documentation, GitHub repositories, and authoritative blogs
- Prioritize results from recognized authorities (official docs, major tech companies, respected developers)

##### IMPORTANT: 5-Research Limit

You are allowed to perform at most **5 researches (max 5 tool calls)**. User might request less. Think carefully based on the task before performing each research.

#### Deep Content Analysis

- When you find a potential GitHub repository URL, use `docs-seeker` skill to read it
- Focus on official documentation, API references, and technical specifications
- Analyze README files from popular GitHub repositories
- Review changelog and release notes for version-specific information

##### Video Content Research

- Prioritize content from official channels, recognized experts, and major conferences
- Focus on practical demonstrations and real-world implementations

##### Cross-Reference Validation

- Verify information across multiple independent sources
- Check publication dates to ensure currency
- Identify consensus vs. controversial approaches
- Note any conflicting information or debates in the community

#### Research Report Template

```markdown

- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects requested by the user
- **Actionability**: Provide practical, implementable recommendations
- **Clarity**: Use clear language, define technical terms, provide examples
- **Attribution**: Always cite sources and provide links for verification

#### Special Considerations

- When researching security topics, always check for recent CVEs and security advisories
- For performance-related research, look for benchmarks and real-world case studies
- When investigating new technologies, assess community adoption and support levels
- For API documentation, verify endpoint availability and authentication requirements
- Always note deprecation warnings and migration paths for older technologies

#### Research Best Practices

- Research breadth before depth
- Document findings for synthesis phase
- Identify multiple approaches for comparison
- Consider edge cases during research
- Note security implications early
- Sacrifice grammar for concision in reports
- List unresolved questions at the end

### 2. Design Context Extraction

> _Content sourced from `references/figma-integration.md`_

**Skip if:** No Figma URLs in source artifacts OR backend-only changes

When planning UI features:

1. Check source PBI/design-spec for Figma URLs
2. Extract design context via Figma MCP (if available)
3. Include design specifications in plan phases
4. Map design tokens to implementation

#### When to Apply

**Apply when:**

- Source artifact contains Figma URLs
- Task involves UI/frontend implementation
- Design specifications are referenced

**Skip when:**

- Backend-only changes
- No Figma URLs in artifacts
- Figma MCP not available (graceful degradation)

#### Detection Phase

##### 1. Scan Source Artifacts

Check these locations for Figma URLs:

- PBI `## Design Reference` section
- Design spec `figma_file:` and `figma_nodes:` frontmatter
- Feature doc Section 6 (Design Reference)

##### 2. Parse URLs

Extract from each URL:

- `file_key`: Figma file identifier
- `node_id`: Specific frame/component (URL format: `1-3`)
- Convert to API format: `1-3` → `1:3`

**URL Pattern:**

```
https://figma.com/design/{file_key}/{name}?node-id={node_id}
```

#### Extraction Phase

##### 1. Check MCP Availability

```
If Figma MCP available:
  → Proceed with extraction
Else:
  → Log: "Figma MCP not configured, skipping design extraction"
  → Continue with URL references only
```

##### 2. Call MCP for Each Node

Prefer specific nodes over full files:

```
For each {file_key, node_id} pair:
  If node_id exists:
    Call: mcp__figma__get_file_nodes(file_key, [node_id])
  Else:
    Skip file-level extraction (too expensive)
```

##### 3. Extract Key Information

From response, extract:

| Property       | Source Field                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**  | `children[].name`, `children[].type`    |
| **Layout**     | `layoutMode`, `itemSpacing`, `padding*` |
| **Dimensions** | `absoluteBoundingBox.width/height`      |
| **Colors**     | `fills[].color` (r,g,b,a → rgba)        |
| **Typography** | `style.fontFamily/fontSize/fontWeight`  |

##### 4. Token Budget Enforcement

| Response Size | Action                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| <2K tokens    | Use full response                     |
| 2K-5K tokens  | Summarize to key properties           |
| >5K tokens    | Extract only critical info, warn user |

#### Integration Phase

##### 1. Add to Plan Context

Include in plan.md overview:

```markdown
## Design Context

Design specifications extracted from Figma:

| Component | Figma Node         | Key Specs              |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| {name}    | [{node_id}]({url}) | {dimensions}, {layout} |

### Extracted Specifications

{Formatted design context from extraction}
```

##### 2. Reference in Implementation Phases

For frontend phases, include:

```markdown
## Design Specifications

From Figma node `{node_id}`:

### Layout

- Direction: {Horizontal/Vertical}
- Gap: {spacing}px
- Padding: {T/R/B/L}px

### Visual

- Background: {color} → map to `--color-bg-*`
- Border: {width}px {color} → map to `--border-*`

### Typography (if text)

- Font: {family} → map to `--font-family-*`
- Size: {size}px → map to `--font-size-*`
- Weight: {weight} → map to `--font-weight-*`
```

##### 3. Design Token Mapping

Map extracted values to existing tokens:

| Figma Value    | Design Token         | Notes            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| #FFFFFF        | `--color-bg-primary` | Exact match      |
| 16px           | `--spacing-md`       | Standard spacing |
| Inter 400 14px | `--font-body`        | Body text        |

Reference: `docs/design-system/tokens.scss` for available tokens.

#### Fallback Behavior

When extraction fails:

1. **MCP Not Available:**
    - Log warning
    - Note in plan: "Design context not extracted (MCP unavailable)"
    - Continue with URL references only

2. **Node Not Found:**
    - Try parent node
    - Note which nodes failed
    - Continue with available data

3. **Rate Limited:**
    - Extract first 3 nodes only
    - Note in plan which nodes were skipped

4. **Token Budget Exceeded:**
    - Summarize aggressively
    - Include only dimensions, colors, layout
    - Link to full Figma for details

#### Figma Output Template

```markdown
## Figma Design Context

> Extracted via Figma MCP on {date}

### Source Designs

| Design | Node          | Status    |
| ------ | ------------- | --------- |
| {name} | [{id}]({url}) | Extracted |

### {Component Name}

**Node:** `{node_id}`
**Type:** {Frame/Component/Group}
**Dimensions:** {width} x {height}px

#### Layout

- Direction: {layoutMode}
- Gap: {itemSpacing}px
- Padding: {paddingTop}/{paddingRight}/{paddingBottom}/{paddingLeft}px

#### Visual

| Property      | Value            | Token Mapping       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Background    | {fill color}     | `--color-*`         |
| Border        | {stroke}         | `--border-*`        |
| Corner Radius | {cornerRadius}px | `--border-radius-*` |

#### Children

- {child1}: {type}
- {child2}: {type}
```

#### No Design Context Template

When no Figma URLs present:

```markdown
## Design Context

No Figma designs referenced. If UI changes are needed:

1. Add Figma links to source PBI `## Design Reference` section
2. Re-run planning to extract design context
```

### 3. Codebase Understanding (**Skip if:** Provided with scout reports)

> _Content sourced from `references/codebase-understanding.md`_

#### Core Activities

##### Parallel Scout Agents

- Use `/scout-ext` (preferred) or `/scout` (fallback) slash command to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task
- Each scout locates files needed for specific task aspects
- Wait for all scout agents to report back before analysis
- Efficient for finding relevant code across large codebases

#### Frontend Solution Design

When designing frontend solutions with Figma context:

##### Design Context Integration

1. **Check for Figma Context**
    - Review extracted design specifications
    - Verify dimensions and spacing match design system
    - Note any custom values needing tokens

2. **Component Structure**
    - Match Figma hierarchy to Angular component tree
    - Identify reusable components
    - Map to existing shared library components

3. **Token Mapping**
    - Map Figma colors to design tokens
    - Verify spacing uses standard tokens
    - Flag any values needing new tokens

4. **Responsive Considerations**

- Consider both technical and business requirements
- Think through the entire user journey
- Plan for monitoring and observability
- Design with testing in mind
- Consider deployment and rollback strategies

### 5. Plan Creation and Organization

> _Content sourced from `references/plan-organization.md`_

#### Directory Structure

##### Plan Location

Use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section injected by hooks. This is the full computed path.

**Example:** `plans/251101-1505-authentication/` or `ai_docs/feature/MRR-1453/`

##### File Organization

```
{plan-dir}/                                    # From `Plan dir:` in ## Naming
├── research/
│   ├── researcher-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── reports/
│   ├── scout-report.md
│   ├── researcher-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md                                    # Overview access point
├── phase-01-setup-environment.md              # Setup environment
├── phase-02-implement-database.md             # Database models
├── phase-03-implement-api-endpoints.md        # API endpoints
├── phase-04-implement-ui-components.md        # UI components
├── phase-05-implement-authentication.md       # Auth & authorization
├── phase-06-implement-profile.md              # Profile page
└── phase-07-write-tests.md                    # Tests
```

##### Active Plan State Tracking

Check the `## Plan Context` section injected by hooks:

- **"Plan: {path}"** = Active plan - use for reports
- **"Suggested: {path}"** = Branch-matched, hint only - do NOT auto-use
- **"Plan: none"** = No active plan

**Pre-Creation Check:**

1. If "Plan:" shows a path → ask "Continue with existing plan? [Y/n]"
2. If "Suggested:" shows a path → inform user (hint only, do NOT auto-use)
3. If "Plan: none" → create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section

**After Creating Plan:**

```bash
# Update session state so subagents get the new plan context:
node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}
```

**Report Output Rules:**

1. Use `Report:` and `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section
2. Active plans use plan-specific reports path
3. Suggested plans use default reports path to prevent old plan pollution

#### Plan File Structure

##### Overview Plan (plan.md)

**IMPORTANT:** All plan.md files MUST include YAML frontmatter. See output standards below for schema.

**Example plan.md structure:**

## Active Plan State

Prevents version proliferation by tracking current working plan via session state.

### Active vs Suggested Plans

Check the `## Plan Context` section injected by hooks:

- **"Plan: {path}"** = Active plan, explicitly set via `set-active-plan.cjs` - use for reports
- **"Suggested: {path}"** = Branch-matched, hint only - do NOT auto-use
- **"Plan: none"** = No active plan

### Rules

1. **If "Plan:" shows a path**: Ask "Continue with existing plan? [Y/n]"
2. **If "Suggested:" shows a path**: Inform user, ask if they want to activate or create new
3. **If "Plan: none"**: Create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section
4. **Update on create**: Run `node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}`

### Report Output Location

All agents writing reports MUST:

1. Check `## Naming` section injected by hooks for the computed naming pattern
2. Active plans use plan-specific reports path
3. Suggested plans use default reports path (not plan folder)

**Important:** Suggested plans do NOT get plan-specific reports - this prevents pollution of old plan folders.

## Quality Standards

- Be thorough and specific
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Research thoroughly when uncertain
- Address security and performance concerns
- Make plans detailed enough for junior developers
- Validate against existing codebase patterns

**Remember:** Plan quality determines implementation success. Be comprehensive and consider all solution aspects.

## **IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
- **MANDATORY FINAL TASKS:** After creating all planning todo tasks, ALWAYS add these two final tasks:
  1. **Task: "Run /plan-validate"** — Trigger `/plan-validate` skill to interview the user with critical questions and validate plan assumptions
  2. **Task: "Run /plan-review"** — Trigger `/plan-review` skill to auto-review plan for validity, correctness, and best practices

## Important Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## REMINDER — Planning-Only Skill

> **DO NOT** use `EnterPlanMode` tool.
> **DO NOT** start implementing.
> **ALWAYS** validate with `/plan-review` after plan creation.
> **ASK** user to confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
> **ASK** user decision questions with your recommendations when multiple approaches exist.
