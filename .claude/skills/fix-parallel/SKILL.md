## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Fix multiple independent issues simultaneously using parallel fullstack-developer subagents.

**Workflow:**

1. **Triage** — Classify issues and verify independence (no shared files)
2. **Assign** — Distribute issues to parallel subagents with strict file ownership
3. **Execute** — Subagents fix issues independently
4. **Merge** — Review and integrate all fixes

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Issues MUST be independent (no overlapping file modifications)
- Each subagent owns specific files; no cross-boundary edits

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-system-context -->

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause analysis + plan creation, MUST present findings + proposed fix plan to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

**Ultrathink parallel** to fix: <issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

**IMPORTANT:** Activate needed skills. Ensure token efficiency. Sacrifice grammar for concision.

## Workflow

### 1. Issue Analysis

- Use `debugger` subagent to analyze root causes
- Use `/scout-ext` to find related files
- Categorize issues by scope/area (frontend, backend, auth, payments, etc.)
- Identify dependencies between issues
- **External Memory**: Each parallel agent writes findings to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}-{agent}.analysis.md`. Main agent re-reads all before coordinating fixes.

### 2. Parallel Fix Planning

- Trigger `/plan-parallel <detailed-fix-instructions>` for parallel-executable fix plan
- Wait for plan with dependency graph, execution strategy, file ownership matrix
- Group independent fixes for parallel execution
- Sequential fixes for dependent issues
- **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for user approval before launching agents.**

### 3. Parallel Fix Implementation

- Read `plan.md` for dependency graph
- Launch multiple `fullstack-developer` agents in PARALLEL for independent fixes
    - Example: "Fix auth + Fix payments + Fix UI" → launch 3 agents simultaneously
    - Pass phase file path: `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-*.md`
    - Include environment info
- Wait for all parallel fixes complete before dependent fixes
- Sequential fixes: launch one agent at a time

**Subagent Context Discipline:**

- **Provide full task text** — paste task content into subagent prompt; don't make subagent read plan file
- **"Ask questions before starting"** — subagent should surface uncertainties before implementing
- **Self-review before reporting** — subagent checks completeness, quality, YAGNI before returning results

### 4. Testing

- Use `tester` subagent for full test suite
- NO fake data/mocks/cheats
- Verify all issues resolved
- If fail: use `debugger`, fix, repeat

### 5. Code Review

<!-- SYNC:two-stage-task-review -->

> **Two-Stage Task Review** — Both stages MUST complete before marking task done.
>
> **Stage 1: Self-review** — Immediately after implementation:
>
> - Requirements met? No regressions? Code quality acceptable?
>
> **Stage 2: Cross-review** — Via `code-reviewer` subagent:
>
> - Catches blind spots, convention drift, missed edge cases
>
> **NEVER skip Stage 2.** Self-review alone misses 40%+ of issues.

<!-- /SYNC:two-stage-task-review -->

    1. First: dispatch `spec-compliance-reviewer` to verify each fix matches its spec
    2. Only after spec passes: dispatch `code-reviewer` for quality review

- Verify fixes don't introduce regressions
- If critical issues: fix, retest

### 6. Project Management & Docs

- If approved: use `project-manager` + `docs-manager` in parallel
- Update plan files, docs, roadmap
- If rejected: fix and repeat

### 7. Prove Fix

- **MANDATORY:** Run `/prove-fix` for EACH parallel fix
- Build code proof traces per change with confidence scores
- If any change scores < 80%, return to debug for that fix

### 8. Final Report

- Summary of all fixes from parallel phases
- Verification status per issue (include prove-fix confidence scores)
- Ask to commit (use `git-manager` if yes)

**Example:** Fix 1 (auth) + Fix 2 (payments) + Fix 3 (UI) → Launch 3 fullstack-developer agents → Wait → Prove each fix → Fix 4 (integration) sequential

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (fixes applied). This ensures prove-fix, review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"/test"** — Run tests to verify fixes
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MUST** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** READ the following files before starting:
    <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **MUST** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
      <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend.
      <!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
- **MUST** include `story_points` and `complexity` in plan frontmatter. SP > 8 = split.
      <!-- /SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:red-flag-stop-conditions:reminder -->
- **MUST** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts. Report all attempts, ask user before continuing.
      <!-- /SYNC:red-flag-stop-conditions:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:ui-system-context:reminder -->
- **MUST** read frontend-patterns-reference, scss-styling-guide, design-system/README before any UI change.
    <!-- /SYNC:ui-system-context:reminder -->
