## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Eliminate the root cause of an issue using parallel subagent investigation — traced end-to-start with `file:line` evidence and fixed at the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site) — then prove the fix with `/prove-fix` so the disease is cured, not just the symptom.

**Workflow:**

1. **Scout** — Use scout/researcher subagents to explore issue in parallel
2. **Diagnose** — Trace root cause through code paths with evidence
3. **Plan** — Create fix plan with impact analysis
4. **Fix** — Implement and verify the fix

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use subagents for parallel investigation of multiple hypotheses
- Always create a plan before implementing complex fixes
- **Target flag** (see [Target Routing](#target-routing---target)): `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` selects a self-contained inline branch that scopes the fix to that domain. No flag = full diagnose→fix spine below.

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD (full rigor).** Every section below — parallel scout/researcher subagents, root-cause tracing with `file:line` evidence, Confidence & Evidence Gate, fix plan with impact analysis, preservation tests for the bug — applies by default.
>
> **Opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL true** (bug genuinely trivial):
>
> - Root cause obvious from error message AND already located (no diagnosis needed)
> - Single-file fix, ≤10 lines changed
> - No cross-service impact, no contract change
> - Test for bug already exists OR bug non-functional (typo, log message)
> - Confidence in fix ≥95% without further investigation
>
> **Any condition fails → use full protocol below.** When in doubt, default hard. Skipping diagnosis on non-trivial bug fixes symptom and leaves disease.
>
> **Fast mode skips (and only skips):** parallel subagent investigation (direct read/grep instead), separate fix plan (inline change), regression-test authoring (only if covering test exists). Does NOT skip Confidence & Evidence Gate, Behavioral Delta Matrix, or running existing test suite.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.**

- Verify each hypothesis against an actual code trace before acting — do NOT assume first hypothesis correct — why: the first guess is usually the nearest-attention trap, not the cause
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove root cause with code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify fix addresses traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

**Ultrathink** plan and start fixing these issues; follow Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team, Development Rules:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## Target Routing (`--target=`)

`/fix` is an intelligent router. With no flag it runs the full diagnose→fix spine below. Pass `--target=` to scope the run to a self-contained inline branch:

| `--target` | Behavior                                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `types`    | **Inline branch (below)** — TypeScript / type-error resolution. |
| `ci`       | **Inline branch (below)** — CI / pipeline failure triage.       |
| `issue`    | **Inline branch (below)** — tracked issue / ticket resolution.  |
| `logs`     | **Inline branch (below)** — log / stack-trace-driven debugging. |
| `test`     | **Inline branch (below)** — failing-test repair.                |
| `ui`       | **Inline branch (below)** — UI / visual-defect fixes.           |

No `--target` (or an unrecognized value) → run the full Workflow spine below; infer the right specialization from `<issues>`.

> **Formerly standalone skills.** `--target=ci|issue|logs|test|ui` were previously the separate skills `/fix-ci`, `/fix-issue`, `/fix-logs`, `/fix-test`, `/fix-ui`; they are now inline branches of `/fix` (folded — the standalone names no longer exist).

### `--target=types` — TypeScript / type-error branch

Run `tsc --noEmit` (or `nx build` / `bun run typecheck` / `npx tsc`) to gather all type errors, then:

1. **Collect** — Capture every type error with `file:line`.
2. **Classify** — Group by cause: missing types, wrong signatures, import/export issues.
3. **Fix at root** — Give each value its real, specific type (or `unknown` + a narrowing guard). Do NOT use `any` to silence the checker — `any` ships the underlying type defect. Fix the root cause (wrong interface, missing export), not the symptom site. — why: `any` silences the checker and lets the type defect ship.
4. **Repeat** until `tsc --noEmit` is clean — zero type errors.
5. **🛑 Validate Before Fix:** present errors + root cause via `AskUserQuestion`, get approval before code changes (skip if inside a workflow).
6. **After fixing, run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ci` — CI / pipeline-failure branch

**Goal:** Analyze CI/CD pipeline logs to identify and fix build/test failures in the configured CI provider/tooling.

**Key Rules:**

- **Infrastructure context:** read `docs/project-config.json` → `infrastructure.cicd.tool` to identify the CI provider/tooling (e.g. `azure-devops`, `github-actions`, `gitlab-ci`); target that provider's pipeline config files.
- Focus on CI-specific issues (env vars, Docker, dependencies, build order).
- Verify the fix does not break local development.

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `debugger` subagent to read the CI logs via the configured CI tool/API (from `docs/project-config.json`), analyze the final failing log/error **backward** to the root cause, and report back. Write findings to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{ci-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before implementing.
2. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for approval.**
3. Implement the fix from the report.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
5. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
6. Report a summary of changes; suggest next steps. Then run `/prove-fix`.

**Notes:** Use the CLI/API for the configured CI provider. If it is GitHub Actions and `gh` is unavailable, instruct the user to install and authorize GitHub CLI first.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=issue` — tracked-issue / ticket branch

**Goal:** Investigate and fix bugs reported as tracked issues (e.g. GitHub issues) with full traceability.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the issue). Map the ticket's acceptance criteria to the saved success criteria; after the fix, append proof evidence and remaining gaps to the Iteration Log. Closure is blocked while any required criterion remains FAIL.

**Key Rules:**

- Link the fix back to the issue for traceability.
- Verify the fix addresses the specific reproduction steps from the issue.

**Workflow:**

1. Activate the `debug-investigate` skill and follow its workflow. See `.claude/docs/AI-DEBUGGING-PROTOCOL.md` for comprehensive guidelines.
2. Use external memory at `.ai/workspace/analysis/issue-[number].analysis.md` for structured analysis. **Re-read the ENTIRE analysis file before proposing any fix.**
3. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for approval before implementing.**
4. Implement, then run `/prove-fix`.

> **Standalone Review Gate (non-workflow only):** if `/fix --target=issue` runs **outside a workflow**, add a `/review-changes` `TaskCreate` todo as the **last** task. Inside a workflow, skip — the sequence handles `/review-changes`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=logs` — log / stack-trace branch

**Goal:** Analyze application logs to diagnose and fix runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

**Key Rules:**

- Focus on log patterns: stack traces, error codes, timing anomalies.
- Cross-reference logs with source code to find the actual root cause.

**Workflow:**

1. Check whether `./logs.txt` exists. If missing, set up permanent log piping in the project's script config (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, …): **Bash/Unix** append `2>&1 | tee logs.txt`; **PowerShell** append `*>&1 | Tee-Object logs.txt`. Run the command to generate logs.
2. Use the `debugger` subagent to analyze `./logs.txt`: read with `Grep` `head_limit: 30` (last 30 lines; increase if needed — avoid loading the whole file). Write analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. Use the `scout` subagent to locate the exact source of the issue; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the fix.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 3.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `/prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=test` — failing-test branch

**Goal:** Run test suites, analyze failures, and fix the underlying code or test issues.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE fixing):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the reported test failure). Map failing-test evidence (before) and passing-test evidence (after) to the saved success criteria in the Iteration Log — a passing suite that misses a saved required criterion does NOT close the loop.

**Key Rules:**

- Distinguish between code bugs and flawed test expectations.
- Re-run tests after the fix to confirm all pass.
- Read `docs/project-reference/integration-test-reference.md` before reviewing/writing integration tests; consult `docs/specs/` for expected-behavior context when diagnosing failures.

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `tester` subagent to compile the code and fix any syntax errors.
2. Use the `tester` subagent to run the tests; report back. Write failure analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{test-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. If tests fail, use the `debugger` subagent to find the root cause; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the plan step by step.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `/prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ui` — UI / visual-defect branch

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix UI/UX issues — layout, styling, responsiveness, and visual bugs.

**Key Rules:**

- Always use BEM classes on template elements.
- Check responsive breakpoints when fixing layout issues.
- **Pre-read (design system):** load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so fixes use real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) and canonical component classes — not invented values.

**Required skills (priority order):** `ui-ux-pro-max` (design-intelligence DB) → `web-design-guidelines` (principles) → `frontend-design` (implementation patterns).

**Workflow:**

**FIRST** — run `ui-ux-pro-max` searches to understand context and common issues:

```bash
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product-type>" --domain product
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<style-keywords>" --domain style
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "accessibility" --domain ux
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "z-index animation" --domain ux
```

If the user provides screenshots/videos, use the `visual analysis tooling` skill to describe the issue in detail so developers can predict the root causes.

> **🛑 After identifying the UI root cause, present findings + proposed fix → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for approval before any code change.**

1. Use the `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the fix step by step (against the design guideline — `designSystem.canonicalDoc`).
2. Capture screenshots (at the exact parent container, not the whole page) and analyze with the appropriate Gemini skill (`visual analysis tooling`, `video-analysis`, or `document-extraction`) so the result matches the design guideline and addresses all issues. Repeat until addressed.
3. Use the browser automation tooling to verify the fix matches the design guideline.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to compile and test; report back. Repeat until all tests pass.
5. **If the user approves:** run the `project-manager` and `docs-manager` subagents in parallel to update plan progress and `./docs`; have `project-manager` also create/update a project roadmap at `./docs/project-roadmap.md`.
6. Report a summary; suggest next steps. Then run `/prove-fix`.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

## Workflow:

If user provides screenshots or videos, use `visual analysis tooling` skill to describe issue in detail; ensure developers can predict root causes from description.

### Fulfill the request

**Question Everything:** Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask probing questions to fully understand user's request, constraints, true objectives. Don't assume — clarify until 100% certain.

- Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify any open questions.
- Ask 1 question at a time; wait for answer before next question.
- No questions → start next step.

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause + plan creation, MUST ATTENTION present findings + proposed fix plan to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.
> **End-to-Start Trace Gate:** For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, stale/incorrect final outputs, or behavior-changing fixes, the root-cause plan MUST ATTENTION include `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and run `/debug-investigate` or `/investigate` before planning code changes.

### Fix the issue

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the reported issue via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`. The saved success criteria define what "fixed" means — a proven local fix that misses a saved required criterion is NOT complete. After proof, append root cause, proof evidence, and remaining goal gaps to the Iteration Log. Tiny fixes may skip deeper gates ONLY with user-accepted reason recorded in the goal file.

Use `sequential-thinking` skill to break complex problems into sequential thought steps.
Use `problem-solving` skills to tackle issues.
Analyze skills catalog and activate other needed skills during the process.

1. Use `debugger` subagent to find root cause and report back to main agent.
   1.5. Write investigation results to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning fix.
   1.6. Confirm the report contains final symptom -> reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/origin, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof.
2. Use `researcher` subagent to research root causes on internet (if needed) and report back.
3. Use `planner` subagent to create implementation plan based on reports; report back.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for user approval.**
5. Use `/code` SlashCommand to implement plan step by step.
6. Final Report:

- Report back to user with summary of changes; explain briefly; guide user to get started; suggest next steps.
- Ask user whether to commit and push to git; if yes, use `git-manager` subagent.

* **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for concision when writing reports.
* **IMPORTANT:** List unresolved questions at end of reports, if any.

**REMEMBER:**

- Generate images with `visual analysis tooling` skills on the fly for visual assets.
- Read and analyze generated assets with `visual analysis tooling` skills to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use media processing tooling as needed.

- **After fixing, MUST ATTENTION run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious" — user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Detect best workflow to continue from here (fix applied). Ensures prove-fix, review, testing, docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"/test"** — Run tests to verify fix
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — workflow handles sequencing.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace -->

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.
>
> **NEVER:** Start at the first suspicious code path. Collapse multiple producers into one "flow". Treat duplicate symptoms as duplicate records without proving the read model. Skip ruled-out hypotheses.

Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

<!-- SYNC:fix-layer-accountability:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace full data flow and fix at the owning layer, not the crash site. Audit all access sites before adding `?.`.

<!-- /SYNC:fix-layer-accountability:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend.

<!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `plans/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source work, read required project-reference docs and cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Always include `lessons.md`; project conventions override generic defaults.
- **MANDATORY** If project config, root instruction files, or any required reference doc is missing, stop and run or ask the user to run `/project-init`.

<!-- /SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- /SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Eliminate the root cause of an issue — traced end-to-start with `file:line` evidence and fixed at the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site) — then prove the fix with `/prove-fix` so the disease is cured, not just the symptom.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD — opt out to fast mode ONLY when bug is genuinely trivial (all 5 conditions met)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks via `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace data flow and fix at owning layer — NEVER at crash site
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks via TaskCreate.
