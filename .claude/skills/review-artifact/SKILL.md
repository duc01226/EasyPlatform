>
> **Round 2:** MANDATORY fresh sub-agent review — see `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. The sub-agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with ZERO Round 1 memory. It must catch:

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Sub-Agent Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias via isolated sub-agents.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/cook`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** Round 2 of ANY review AND every recursive re-review iteration after fixes. NOT needed when Round 1 already PASSes with zero issues.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Spawn a NEW `Agent` tool call — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - NEVER skip fresh-subagent review because "last round was clean" — every fix triggers a fresh round
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — escalate via `AskUserQuestion` if still failing; do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol
> - Track iteration count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

<!-- SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 10 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 10 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 10 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: JS: === vs ==, typeof null. C#: async void, missing using, LINQ deferred execution.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. From changed files → find TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} in docs/business-features/{Service}/detailed-features/{Feature}.md Section 15.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding TC (or flag as "needs TC").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Verify TC evidence fields point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
5. Auth changes → TC-{FEAT}-02x exist? Data changes → TC-{FEAT}-01x exist?
6. If no specs exist → log gap and recommend /tdd-spec.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.

```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 10 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- /SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — flag duplicated patterns that should be extracted to a base class, generic, or helper. Classes in the same group or suffix (ex *Entity, *Dto, \*Service, etc...) MUST ATTENTION inherit a common base (even if empty now — enables future shared logic and child overrides). Verify project has code linting/analyzer configured for the stack.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review an artifact (PBI, design spec, story, test spec) for completeness and quality before handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — What artifact type is being reviewed
2. **Checklist** — Apply type-specific quality criteria
3. **Verdict** — READY or NEEDS WORK with specific items

**Key Rules:**

- Use type-specific checklists
- Every NEEDS WORK item must be actionable
- Never block on stylistic preferences — focus on completeness

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Adversarial Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Default stance: SKEPTIC challenging artifact quality and completeness, not confirming presence of sections.**

> **Presence-quality confusion trap:** An artifact with all required sections LOOKS complete. But sections that exist but contain weak, ambiguous, or untestable content are worse than missing sections — they create false confidence. This section forces quality challenge beyond existence checks.

### Adversarial Techniques (apply ALL before concluding)

**1. Steel-Man the Alternatives**
Before accepting the chosen approach in any design artifact: argue FOR the strongest rejected alternative as vigorously as possible. Would a senior domain expert seriously consider it? If yes — the artifact's dismissal needs stronger justification.

**2. Assumption Stress Test**
List the 3 biggest assumptions embedded in the artifact. For each: "What if this is wrong?" An artifact that breaks when 2 of its 3 core assumptions fail is fragile. Flag unaddressed failure modes.

**3. Acceptance Criteria Testability**
For each acceptance criterion: "Can a QA engineer write a specific automated test for this — without asking clarifying questions?" If not — the AC is ambiguous. Flag it. Vague ACs ("the feature works correctly") are NOT acceptance criteria.

**4. Pre-Mortem**
Assume the artifact is implemented exactly as written and the feature fails in production within 3 months. Write the most plausible failure scenario. If you can't find one, look harder — every implementation has a failure mode.

**5. Unseen Alternatives**
Identify 1-2 approaches NOT mentioned in the artifact. Were they genuinely not considered, or considered and excluded without documented reasoning? Missing alternatives without exclusion reasoning = incomplete analysis.

**6. Contrarian Pass**
Before writing any verdict, generate at least 2 sentences arguing the OPPOSITE conclusion. Then decide which argument is stronger based on evidence.

### Forbidden Patterns

- **"Required sections present"** → Presence ≠ quality. What's IN them?
- **"Acceptance criteria are defined"** → Are they TESTABLE? Name the automated test for each.
- **"Scope is well-defined"** → What is explicitly OUT of scope? If nothing is out of scope, the scope is undefined.
- **"Alternatives were considered"** → Were they real alternatives, or strawmen set up to lose?
- **"Looks complete"** → What specific failure mode is NOT addressed?

### Anti-Bias Gate (MANDATORY before finalizing verdict)

- [ ] Steel-manned at least one rejected alternative
- [ ] Identified 3 hidden assumptions and stress-tested them
- [ ] Verified each AC is unambiguously testable (can write automated test without clarification)
- [ ] Ran pre-mortem (one concrete production failure scenario)
- [ ] Identified at least 1 unexamined alternative (not in artifact)
- [ ] Generated at least 2 sentences arguing the opposite verdict

If any box is unchecked → adversarial review incomplete. Go back.

## Type-Specific Checklists

### PBI Review

| #   | Check                                                                                                      | Presence                                                  | Quality Depth                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Problem statement is clear** — the problem being solved is described in concrete terms                   | Is a problem statement present? Is it 2+ sentences?       | Is the problem scoped correctly? Could it be framed differently to lead to a different (simpler) solution? Are symptoms confused with root cause?                                              |
| 2   | **Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable** — each AC can be verified by a test                    | Are ACs present? Do they use measurable language?         | Can a QA engineer write an automated test for EACH AC without clarification? Are they specific enough to catch regressions? Vague ACs ("feature works correctly") are not acceptance criteria. |
| 3   | **Scope is well-defined (what's in and out)** — both in-scope and out-of-scope items are explicitly listed | Is an in/out scope list present? Does it have both sides? | Are out-of-scope items specific enough to prevent scope creep? Is anything ambiguously in/out? A scope that says nothing is out of scope is an undefined scope.                                |
| 4   | **Dependencies are identified** — all external dependencies the PBI relies on are listed                   | Is a dependencies section present? Does it list items?    | Are ALL dependencies listed (technical, data, service, team)? Are "can-parallel" items truly safe to parallelize, or do they share a shared resource?                                          |
| 5   | **Business value is articulated** — the why behind the PBI is stated in terms of user or business outcome  | Is business value described?                              | Is the value quantified or just stated? Does it connect to a user outcome, not just a feature delivery? "Users can now do X" is better than "we implemented feature Y".                        |
| 6   | **Priority is assigned** — the PBI has an explicit priority level                                          | Is a priority level assigned?                             | Is priority justified with data (RICE/MoSCoW), or arbitrary? Is it consistent with other PBIs in the same sprint? A PBI that is "high priority" without justification is unranked.             |

### User Story Review

| #   | Check                                                                                                                    | Presence                                                       | Quality Depth                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Follows GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format** — the story uses the structured BDD format                                            | Are all three parts (GIVEN, WHEN, THEN) present?               | Are all 3 parts present AND meaningful? Or is GIVEN trivial ("Given a user exists")? A GIVEN that describes no precondition adds no value.                    |
| 2   | **Is independent (not dependent on other stories)** — the story can be implemented without requiring another story first | Is independence stated or inferable?                           | Would descoping other stories prevent this story from being implemented? Implicit dependencies are as blocking as explicit ones.                              |
| 3   | **Is estimable (team can size it)** — the team has enough information to assign story points                             | Is the story sized or estimable based on content?              | Does the team have enough info to estimate? Is "can't estimate" a sign of missing AC? If it can't be sized, it's not ready for sprint.                        |
| 4   | **Is small enough for one sprint** — the story fits within a single sprint's capacity                                    | Is the story sized at ≤8 story points or scoped to one sprint? | Could this be split further? Stories >8SP should always be split. A story that "could fit" in a sprint but requires multiple sub-systems is likely too large. |
| 5   | **Has acceptance criteria** — the story defines measurable conditions for completion                                     | Are acceptance criteria present?                               | Are criteria testable? Would they catch a bug if the feature works in 9/10 cases? ACs that only describe the happy path are incomplete.                       |

| 1   | **All component states covered (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)** — spec defines visual behavior for all interaction states | Are all 6 states defined?                           | Are edge-case states (error, loading) as fully designed as the default state, or sketched? An undesigned error state will be improvised in implementation.                                      |
| 2   | **Design tokens specified (colors, spacing, typography)** — specific token values are called out, not ad-hoc values                           | Are token references present instead of raw values? | Are tokens from the project's token system, or are new values introduced? New values outside the token system break design consistency silently.                                                |
| 3   | **Responsive behavior defined** — how the component adapts across breakpoints is documented                                                   | Are breakpoint behaviors defined?                   | Are ALL breakpoints covered, or only desktop and mobile? Tablet-specific layouts are the most frequently omitted. Are content truncation / overflow behaviors specified?                        |
| 4   | **Accessibility requirements noted** — WCAG-relevant requirements (color contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA) are documented                         | Are accessibility notes present?                    | Are requirements specific (WCAG level, contrast ratio) or vague ("should be accessible")? Vague accessibility notes produce non-compliant implementations. Is keyboard navigation flow defined? |
| 5   | **Interaction patterns documented** — animations, transitions, and user interaction flows are specified                                       | Are interaction behaviors described?                | Are timing and easing values specified? Is behavior defined for both forward and reverse interactions (e.g., open AND close)? Unspecified interactions are implemented inconsistently.          |

### Test Spec Review

| 1   | **Coverage adequate for acceptance criteria** — each AC maps to at least one test case               | Is there a test for each AC?                | Is coverage 1:1 (each AC has one test) or is each AC covered by multiple test angles (boundary, happy path, error)? Single-test-per-AC misses edge cases.                    |
| 2   | **Edge cases included** — boundary conditions and atypical inputs are tested                         | Are edge case tests present?                | Are edge cases derived from the AC boundaries (min/max values, empty inputs, nulls), or are they generic? Edge cases that aren't tied to actual boundaries are noise.        |
| 3   | **Test data requirements specified** — the data setup needed to run each test is documented          | Are test data requirements stated per test? | Is test data specific enough to create fixtures without guessing? Vague data requirements ("a valid user") will cause test setup divergence across environments.             |
| 4   | **GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format used** — tests follow the structured BDD format                             | Are all tests written in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN?   | Are the THEN clauses assertions on observable outcomes, or on internal state? Tests asserting on internal state are brittle and break on refactoring.                        |
| 5   | **Negative test cases included** — tests cover rejection, failure, and unauthorized access scenarios | Are negative tests present?                 | Do negative tests assert on specific error conditions (error code, message) or just that an error occurred? Unspecific negative tests don't verify correct failure behavior. |

## Readability Checklist (MUST ATTENTION evaluate)

Before approving, verify the code is **easy to read, easy to maintain, easy to understand**:

- **Schema visibility** — If a function computes a data structure (object, map, config), a comment should show the output shape so readers don't have to trace the code
- **Non-obvious data flows** — If data transforms through multiple steps (A → B → C), a brief comment should explain the pipeline
- **Self-documenting signatures** — Function params should explain their role; flag unused params
- **Magic values** — Unexplained numbers/strings should be named constants or have inline rationale
- **Naming clarity** — Variables/functions should reveal intent without reading the implementation

## Output Format

```
## Artifact Review

**Artifact Type:** [PBI | Story | Design | Test Spec]
**Artifact:** [Reference/title]
**Date:** {date}
**Verdict:** READY | NEEDS WORK

### Checklist Results
- [pass] [Item] — [evidence]
- [fail] [Item] — [what's missing/wrong]

### Action Items (if NEEDS WORK)
1. [Specific actionable item]
```

## Round 2+ : Fresh Sub-Agent Re-Review (MANDATORY)

> **Protocol:** `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` + `SYNC:fresh-context-review` + `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` (all inlined above in this file).

After completing Round 1 evaluation, spawn a **fresh `general-purpose` sub-agent** for Round 2 using the canonical Agent template from `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` above. Artifact reviews (PBI, story, design spec, test spec) are NOT code — use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, not `"code-reviewer"`. When constructing the Agent call prompt:

1. Copy the Agent call shape from the `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` template verbatim
2. Set `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
3. Embed the full verbatim body of these SYNC blocks (inlined above in this skill file): `SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning`, `SYNC:rationalization-prevention`, `SYNC:understand-code-first` (omit code-specific protocols like `SYNC:bug-detection`, `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:fix-layer-accountability` which are not applicable to artifact files)
4. Set the Task as `"Review the {artifact-type} artifact for completeness and quality. Focus on: implicit assumptions, missing coverage of edge cases / error scenarios, unverified cross-references, completeness gaps only visible on second reading, whether acceptance criteria are truly testable and measurable."`
5. Set Target Files as the explicit artifact file path(s)
6. Set report path as `plans/reports/review-artifact-round{N}-{date}.md`

After sub-agent returns:

1. **Read** the sub-agent's report
2. **Integrate** findings as `## Round {N} Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` in the main report — DO NOT filter or override
3. **If NEEDS WORK:** fix artifact issues, then spawn a NEW Round N+1 fresh sub-agent (new Agent call — never reuse Round 2's agent)
4. **Max 3 fresh rounds** — escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion` if still failing after 3 rounds
5. **Final verdict** must incorporate findings from ALL rounds

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

---

## Systematic Review Protocol (for 10+ artifacts)

> **When reviewing many artifacts at once, categorize by type, fire parallel `code-reviewer` sub-agents per category, then synchronize findings.** See `review-changes/SKILL.md` § "Systematic Review Protocol" for the full 4-step protocol (Categorize → Parallel Sub-Agents → Synchronize → Holistic Assessment).

---

## AI Agent Integrity Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **Completion ≠ Correctness.** Before reporting ANY work done, prove it:
>
> 1. **Grep every removed name.** Extraction/rename/delete touched N files? Grep confirms 0 dangling refs across ALL file types.
> 2. **Ask WHY before changing.** Existing values are intentional until proven otherwise. No "fix" without traced rationale.
> 3. **Verify ALL outputs.** One build passing ≠ all builds passing. Check every affected stack.
> 4. **Evaluate pattern fit.** Copying nearby code? Verify preconditions match — same scope, lifetime, base class, constraints.
> 5. **New artifact = wired artifact.** Created something? Prove it's registered, imported, and reachable by all consumers.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
<!-- SYNC:graph-impact-analysis:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `blast-radius` when graph.db exists. Flag impacted files NOT in changeset as potentially stale.

<!-- /SYNC:graph-impact-analysis:reminder -->
<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->
<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute two review rounds (Round 1: understand, Round 2: catch missed issues)

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
