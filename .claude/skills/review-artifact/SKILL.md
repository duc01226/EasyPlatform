description: '[Code Quality] Review artifact quality before handoff. Use to verify PBIs, designs, stories meet quality standards.'

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before executing.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review an artifact (PBI, design spec, story, test spec) for completeness and quality before handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — What artifact type is being reviewed
2. **Checklist** — Apply type-specific quality criteria
3. **Verdict** — READY or NEEDS WORK with specific items

**Key Rules:**

- Use type-specific checklists
- Every NEEDS WORK item must be actionable
- Never block on stylistic preferences — focus on completeness

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Type-Specific Checklists

### PBI Review

- [ ] Problem statement is clear
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- [ ] Scope is well-defined (what's in and out)
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Business value is articulated
- [ ] Priority is assigned

### User Story Review

- [ ] Follows GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- [ ] Is independent (not dependent on other stories)
- [ ] Is estimable (team can size it)
- [ ] Is small enough for one sprint
- [ ] Has acceptance criteria

### Design Spec Review

- [ ] All component states covered (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)
- [ ] Design tokens specified (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] Responsive behavior defined
- [ ] Accessibility requirements noted
- [ ] Interaction patterns documented

### Test Spec Review

- [ ] Coverage adequate for acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge cases included
- [ ] Test data requirements specified
- [ ] GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format used
- [ ] Negative test cases included

## Readability Checklist (MUST evaluate)

Before approving, verify the code is **easy to read, easy to maintain, easy to understand**:

- **Schema visibility** — If a function computes a data structure (object, map, config), a comment should show the output shape so readers don't have to trace the code
- **Non-obvious data flows** — If data transforms through multiple steps (A → B → C), a brief comment should explain the pipeline
- **Self-documenting signatures** — Function params should explain their role; flag unused params
- **Magic values** — Unexplained numbers/strings should be named constants or have inline rationale
- **Naming clarity** — Variables/functions should reveal intent without reading the implementation

## Output Format

```
## Artifact Review

**Artifact Type:** [PBI | Story | Design | Test Spec]
**Artifact:** [Reference/title]
**Date:** {date}
**Verdict:** READY | NEEDS WORK

### Checklist Results
- [pass] [Item] — [evidence]
- [fail] [Item] — [what's missing/wrong]

### Action Items (if NEEDS WORK)
1. [Specific actionable item]
```

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

## Systematic Review Protocol (for 10+ artifacts)

> **When reviewing many artifacts at once, categorize by type, fire parallel `code-reviewer` sub-agents per category, then synchronize findings.** See `review-changes/SKILL.md` § "Systematic Review Protocol" for the full 4-step protocol (Categorize → Parallel Sub-Agents → Synchronize → Holistic Assessment).
