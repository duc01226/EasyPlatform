## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Scan backend codebase → populate `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md` with actual patterns (repositories, CQRS, validation, entities, events, migrations, DI, authorization). Every example from real project files with `file:line`. (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)

**Workflow:**

1. **Assess** — Read target doc, detect init vs sync mode, classify framework
2. **Scan** — Parallel sub-agents discover patterns with `file:line` evidence
3. **Anti-pattern pass** — Dedicated sub-agent hunts violations
4. **Report** — Write structured findings to report file (incremental, not batched)
5. **Generate** — Surgical update of reference doc from report
6. **Verify** — Multi-round fresh-eyes review validates examples and coverage

**Key Rules:**

- **MUST ATTENTION** detect framework FIRST — scan strategy derives from framework, not hardcoded
- **MUST ATTENTION** every code example from actual project files with `file:line` — NEVER fabricate
- **MUST ATTENTION** run graph command on key files before concluding — grep finds text, graph finds structure
- Surgical update only — NEVER rewrite entire doc, NEVER remove section without evidence it's obsolete

# Scan Backend Patterns

## Phase 0: Classify & Assess

**Before any other step**, run in parallel:

1. Read `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`
    - Detect mode: Init (placeholder — headings only) or Sync (populated)
    - In Sync mode: list already-documented sections → skip re-scanning those unless staleness suspected
2. Detect backend framework:

| Signal                                  | Framework            | Next Step                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.csproj` + `MediatR`/`PlatformCqrs`    | .NET / Easy.Platform | Scan for CQRS, PlatformValidationResult, entity events |
| `package.json` + express/fastify/nestjs | Node.js              | Scan for DI decorators, class-validator, TypeORM       |
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle`              | Java/Kotlin          | Scan for Spring annotations, JPA patterns              |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`   | Python               | Scan for Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI patterns        |

3. Load service paths from `docs/project-config.json` contextGroups/modules if available
4. Run graph command on primary service entry point: `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <entry-file> --direction both --json`

**Evidence gate:** Confidence <60% on framework detection → report uncertainty, DO NOT proceed with framework-specific scan.

## Phase 1: Plan Scan Strategy

From detected framework, derive:

- Repository interface naming pattern (e.g., `I{Service}RootRepository<T>` vs `extends Repository<T>`)
- Handler base class (e.g., `IRequestHandler<TCmd, TResult>` vs `@CommandHandler`)
- Validation mechanism (e.g., `PlatformValidationResult` vs `FluentValidation` vs class-validator)
- Event mechanism (e.g., `PlatformEntityEvent` vs domain events vs integration events)
- Migration tool (e.g., EF migrations vs Flyway vs Alembic)

**Create TaskCreate entries** for each sub-agent and each phase before proceeding.

NEVER assume these patterns — derive from actual file evidence.

## Phase 2: Execute Scan (Parallel Sub-Agents)

Launch **4 general-purpose sub-agents** in parallel. Each sub-agent MUST:

- Write findings incrementally after each file/section — NEVER batch at end
- Cite `file:line` for every pattern example
- Confidence: >80% document as pattern; 60-80% document as "observed (unverified)"; <60% omit

All findings → `plans/reports/scan-backend-patterns-{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-report.md`

### Sub-Agent 1: Repository & Entity Patterns

**Think:** What is the complete chain from domain entity → persistence → retrieval? Where does business logic live — in the entity, the service, or the handler? What makes a "repository" in this project (naming, base class, interface)?

Scan targets (derive grep terms from detected framework):

- Repository interfaces — naming convention, base classes, service-specific vs generic
- Entity/model base classes — inheritance chain, property conventions, factory methods
- Domain logic placement — business rules in entities vs services vs handlers
- DTO classes — mapping ownership (DTO-owned vs handler-mapped vs AutoMapper)
- Repository extension methods — static query expressions, reusable filters

For each pattern found: record `file:line`, extract 5-15 line snippet, note GOOD vs BAD if anti-pattern present.

### Sub-Agent 2: CQRS & Validation Patterns

**Think:** How does a request travel from controller to handler? What validates it? What wraps the result? Where does authorization live?

Scan targets:

- Command handlers — file structure, naming conventions, base class, result types
- Query handlers — pagination patterns, projection patterns, caching if any
- Validation — mechanism, where validation lives (handler vs pipeline vs entity), error response format
- Request/response wrappers — `Result<T>`, `ApiResponse`, `PlatformValidationResult` equivalents
- Controller/endpoint patterns — route conventions, auth attributes, request binding
- Authorization — attribute/decorator placement, policy-based vs role-based, permission check location

### Sub-Agent 3: Events, Messaging & Infrastructure

**Think:** How do side effects happen — synchronous or async? How do services communicate? What triggers background work?

Scan targets:

- Domain events — trigger mechanism, handler discovery, side-effect placement rules
- Integration events / message bus — publisher conventions, consumer conventions, message contract naming
- Background jobs — scheduler, recurring vs one-time, failure handling
- Middleware/pipeline — order, cross-cutting concerns (logging, tracing, error handling)
- DI registration — service lifetime conventions, module registration patterns
- Migration patterns — migration file naming, up/down conventions, data migration approach

For message bus: capture FULL naming pattern for message contracts (ownership prefix matters).

### Sub-Agent 4: Anti-Pattern Detection

**Think:** Where has the team violated the conventions found by Agents 1-3? Look for the 8 most common backend anti-patterns: wrong repo type, wrong logic layer, exception-based validation, cross-service DB access, handler-owned DTO mapping, uncleaned async scopes, unnamed bus contracts, hardcoded config.

Run AFTER Agents 1-3 complete. Checklist:

- Generic repository usage where service-specific required
- Business logic in handlers/components that belongs in entities/models
- Validation via exceptions instead of validation result type
- Direct DB access across service boundaries
- DTO mapping in handlers instead of DTO-owned mapping
- Bus message naming without ownership prefix
- Hard-coded config values that should be injected

For each violation: record `file:line`, classify severity (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR), suggest fix.

## Phase 3: Analyze & Generate

Read full report. Apply fresh-eyes protocol:

**Round 1 (main agent):** Build section drafts from report findings.

**Round 2 (fresh sub-agent, zero memory of Round 1):** Sub-agent re-reads report + draft doc independently.

- Does every code example match an actual existing file (Glob verify)?
- Do class names in examples match actual class definitions (Grep verify)?
- Are anti-patterns documented alongside patterns?
- Coverage gaps: which Target Sections have no examples?

**Round 3 only if Round 2 finds issues.** Max 3 rounds → escalate to user if unresolved.

### Target Sections

| Section                 | Content                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository Pattern**  | Interface naming, base classes, service-specific repos, extension methods with examples |
| **CQRS Patterns**       | Command structure, query structure, handler patterns, file organization                 |
| **Validation Patterns** | Mechanism, common rules, error response format, DO/DON'T examples                       |
| **Entity Patterns**     | Base classes, property conventions, factory methods, domain logic placement             |
| **DTO Mapping**         | Mapping ownership (who maps: DTO vs handler vs service), examples                       |
| **Event Handlers**      | Domain vs integration events, handler discovery, side-effect placement                  |
| **Message Bus**         | Cross-service patterns, consumer conventions, message contract naming                   |
| **DI & Configuration**  | Service lifetime conventions, module registration, config injection                     |
| **Migrations**          | Strategy, file naming, data migration patterns                                          |
| **Background Jobs**     | Scheduler, recurring vs one-time, failure handling                                      |
| **Authorization**       | Auth mechanism, permission checks, policy vs role                                       |
| **Anti-Patterns**       | Confirmed violations with `file:line`, severity, fix guidance                           |

### Content Rules

- Code snippets 5-15 lines from actual project files with `file:line`
- DO/DON'T pairs where anti-patterns confirmed (BAD: `file:line` / GOOD: `file:line`)
- Tables for convention summaries (naming, file locations, base classes)
- Anti-Patterns section: list violations found in Phase 2 Sub-Agent 4

## Phase 4: Write & Verify

1. Write updated doc with `<!-- Last scanned: YYYY-MM-DD -->` at top
2. Surgical update only — preserve sections with no staleness, update only diverged sections
3. Verify (Glob check): ALL code example file paths exist — not just 5
4. Verify (Grep check): class names in examples match actual class definitions
5. Verify: Anti-Patterns section populated with actual `file:line` violations (not hypothetical)
6. Run graph command on 2-3 key pattern files to validate call chain accuracy
7. Report: sections updated / unchanged / coverage gaps / violations found

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small `TaskCreate` tasks BEFORE starting — one task per sub-agent, one per phase
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect framework FIRST in Phase 0 — all grep terms derive from detection, never hardcoded
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` for every pattern (confidence >80% to document; <60% omit)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run graph command on key files — grep finds text, graph finds structure (callers, event chains, blast radius)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** sub-agents write findings incrementally after each file — NEVER batch at end (context loss)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read existing doc FIRST, diff findings, surgical update only — NEVER rewrite entire doc
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Anti-Patterns section requires real `file:line` violations — NEVER fabricate hypothetical examples
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** multi-round fresh-eyes review — main agent rationalizes its own mistakes; Round 2 sub-agent catches what main agent dismissed

| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Framework already known, skip Phase 0 detection" | Phase 0 is BLOCKING — derive grep terms from evidence, not assumption               |
| "Only 3 agents needed, skip anti-pattern agent"   | Anti-pattern detection is separate concern — NEVER merge with discovery             |
| "Doc has content, skip re-read"                   | Show section list extracted from doc as proof of re-read                            |
| "Examples look right"                             | Glob-verify ALL file paths + Grep-verify ALL class names — looking right ≠ verified |
| "Round 2 review not needed for small scan"        | Main agent rationalizes own mistakes. Fresh sub-agent is non-negotiable.            |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
