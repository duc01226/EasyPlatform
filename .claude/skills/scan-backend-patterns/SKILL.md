> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

<!-- SYNC:scan-and-update-reference-doc -->

> **Scan & Update Reference Doc** — Surgical updates only, never full rewrite.
>
> 1. **Read existing doc** first — understand current structure and manual annotations
> 2. **Detect mode:** Placeholder (only headings, no content) → Init mode. Has content → Sync mode.
> 3. **Scan codebase** for current state (grep/glob for patterns, counts, file paths)
> 4. **Diff** findings vs doc content — identify stale sections only
> 5. **Update ONLY** sections where code diverged from doc. Preserve manual annotations.
> 6. **Update metadata** (date, counts, version) in frontmatter or header
> 7. **NEVER** rewrite entire doc. NEVER remove sections without evidence they're obsolete.

> **Output Quality** — Token efficiency without sacrificing quality.
>
> 1. No inventories/counts — AI can `grep | wc -l`. Counts go stale instantly
> 2. No directory trees — AI can `glob`/`ls`. Use 1-line path conventions
> 3. No TOCs — AI reads linearly. TOC wastes tokens
> 4. No examples that repeat what rules say — one example only if non-obvious
> 5. Lead with answer, not reasoning. Skip filler words and preamble
> 6. Sacrifice grammar for concision in reports
> 7. Unresolved questions at end, if any

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Scan backend codebase and populate `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md` with actual repository patterns, CQRS command/query structures, validation patterns, entity conventions, event handlers, and migration approaches. (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)

**Workflow:**

1. **Read** — Load current target doc, detect init vs sync mode
2. **Scan** — Discover backend patterns via parallel sub-agents
3. **Report** — Write findings to external report file
4. **Generate** — Build/update reference doc from report
5. **Verify** — Validate code examples reference real files

**Key Rules:**

- Generic — works with any backend framework (.NET, Node.js, Java, etc.)
- Detect framework first, then scan for framework-specific patterns
- Every code example must come from actual project files with file:line references

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Scan Backend Patterns

## Phase 0: Read & Assess

1. Read `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`
2. Detect mode: init (placeholder) or sync (populated)
3. If sync: extract existing sections and note what's already well-documented

## Phase 1: Plan Scan Strategy

Detect backend framework:

- `.csproj` files → .NET (check for MediatR, CQRS patterns)
- `package.json` with express/fastify/nestjs → Node.js
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` → Java/Kotlin
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python

Use `docs/project-config.json` contextGroups/modules if available for service paths.

## Phase 2: Execute Scan (Parallel Sub-Agents)

Launch **3 Explore agents** in parallel:

### Agent 1: Repository & Entity Patterns

- Grep for repository interfaces (`interface I*Repository`, `extends Repository`)
- Find entity/model classes (base class inheritance, attributes/annotations)
- Find DTO classes and mapping patterns (AutoMapper, manual mapping, `MapTo*` methods)
- Discover data access patterns (Unit of Work, DbContext, MongoDB collections)
- Look for extension methods on repositories

### Agent 2: CQRS & Command/Query Patterns

- Grep for command handlers (`IRequestHandler`, `CommandHandler`, `@CommandHandler`)
- Grep for query handlers, query objects
- Find validation patterns (FluentValidation, class-level validators, middleware)
- Discover request/response wrapper patterns (Result<T>, ApiResponse)
- Find authorization attributes/decorators on handlers

### Agent 3: Events, Migrations & Infrastructure

- Grep for event handlers, domain events, integration events
- Find message bus consumers/publishers (MassTransit, RabbitMQ, Kafka patterns)
- Discover migration patterns (EF migrations, Flyway, custom migrators)
- Find background job patterns (Hangfire, Quartz, hosted services)
- Grep for middleware, filters, interceptors

Write all findings to: `plans/reports/scan-backend-patterns-{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-report.md`

## Phase 3: Analyze & Generate

Read the report. Build these sections:

### Target Sections

| Section                 | Content                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository Pattern**  | Interface naming, base classes, service-specific repos, extension methods with examples |
| **CQRS Patterns**       | Command structure, query structure, handler patterns, file organization conventions     |
| **Validation Patterns** | Validation approach (fluent API, attributes, etc.), common rules, error response format |
| **Entity Patterns**     | Base classes, property conventions, factory methods, domain logic placement             |
| **DTO Mapping**         | Mapping approach, who owns mapping (DTO, handler, or service), examples                 |
| **Event Handlers**      | Domain events vs integration events, handler discovery, side-effect placement           |
| **Message Bus**         | Cross-service communication patterns, consumer conventions, message contracts           |
| **Migrations**          | Migration strategy, naming conventions, data migration patterns                         |
| **Background Jobs**     | Job scheduling, recurring jobs, one-time jobs, conventions                              |
| **Authorization**       | Auth patterns, permission checks, role-based access                                     |

### Content Rules

- Show actual code snippets (5-15 lines) from the project with `file:line` references
- Include "DO" and "DON'T" examples where anti-patterns are clear
- Use tables for convention summaries (naming, file locations, base classes)
- Group patterns by concern, not by framework feature

## Phase 4: Write & Verify

1. Write updated doc with `<!-- Last scanned: YYYY-MM-DD -->` at top
2. Verify: 5 code example file paths exist (Glob check)
3. Verify: class names in examples match actual class definitions
4. Report: sections updated, patterns discovered, coverage gaps

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
  <!-- SYNC:scan-and-update-reference-doc:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read existing doc first, scan codebase, diff, surgical update only. Never rewrite entire doc.
  <!-- /SYNC:scan-and-update-reference-doc:reminder -->
  <!-- SYNC:output-quality-principles:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow output quality rules: no counts/trees/TOCs, rules > descriptions, 1 example per pattern, primacy-recency anchoring.
  <!-- /SYNC:output-quality-principles:reminder -->
