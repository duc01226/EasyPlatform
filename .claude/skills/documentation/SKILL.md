> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Enhance code documentation, API docs, README files, and technical writing with verified accuracy.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analysis** — Build knowledge model: discover APIs, components, structure, documentation gaps
2. **Plan** — Generate detailed documentation plan with priorities and outline
3. **Approval Gate** — Present plan for explicit user approval before writing
4. **Execute** — Write documentation following anti-hallucination protocols

**Key Rules:**

- Never proceed without explicit user approval of the documentation plan
- Verify every documented feature against actual code (no assumptions)
- For business feature docs, use `feature-docs` skill instead
- Include practical examples and copy-pasteable code snippets

> **Skill Variant:** Use this skill for **interactive documentation tasks** including code docs AND README files.

## Disambiguation

- For **business feature docs** → use `feature-docs`
- This skill covers **code documentation** and **README files**

# Documentation Enhancement

You are to operate as an expert technical writer and software documentation specialist to enhance documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

**Prerequisites:** **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before executing.

## PHASE 1: EXTERNAL MEMORY-DRIVEN DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

Build a structured knowledge model in `.ai/workspace/analysis/[task-name].analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND DISCOVERY

1. **Initialize** the analysis file with standard headings
2. **Discovery searches** for all related files

### DOCUMENTATION-SPECIFIC DISCOVERY

**DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETENESS_DISCOVERY**: Focus on documentation-relevant patterns:

1. **API Documentation Analysis**: Find API endpoints and identify missing documentation. Document under `## API Documentation`.

2. **Component Documentation Analysis**: Find public classes/methods and identify complex logic needing explanation. Document under `## Component Documentation`.

3. **Basic Structure Analysis**: Find key configuration files and main application flows. Document under `## Structure Documentation`.

**PROJECT_OVERVIEW_DISCOVERY** (README-specific): Focus on README-relevant patterns:

1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Find entry points, map key directories, identify technologies
2. **Feature Discovery**: Find user-facing features and map API endpoints
3. **Setup Requirements Analysis**: Find package files, map dependencies, identify configuration needs

### PHASE 1B: SYSTEMATIC FILE ANALYSIS FOR DOCUMENTATION

> **IMPORTANT:** Must do with todo list.

For each file, document in `## Knowledge Graph`:

- Standard fields plus documentation-specific:
- `documentationGaps`: Missing or incomplete documentation
- `complexityLevel`: How difficult to understand (1-10)
- `userFacingFeatures`: Features needing user documentation
- `developerNotes`: Technical details needing developer docs
- `exampleRequirements`: Code examples or usage scenarios needed
- `apiDocumentationNeeds`: API endpoints requiring documentation
- `configurationOptions`: Configuration parameters needing explanation
- `troubleshootingAreas`: Common issues requiring troubleshooting docs

README-specific fields (when analyzing for README documentation):

| Field                | Description                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `readmeRelevance`    | How component should be represented (1-10) |
| `userImpact`         | How component affects end users            |
| `setupRequirements`  | Prerequisites for this component           |
| `configurationNeeds` | Configuration required                     |
| `featureDescription` | User-facing features provided              |
| `exampleUsage`       | Usage examples for README                  |
| `projectContext`     | How it fits into overall project           |

### PHASE 1C: OVERALL ANALYSIS

Write comprehensive summary showing:

- Complete end-to-end workflows discovered
- Documentation gaps identified
- Priority areas for documentation
- Key features and capabilities (README)
- Setup and configuration requirements (README)

---

## PHASE 2: DOCUMENTATION PLAN GENERATION

Generate detailed documentation plan under `## Documentation Plan`:

- Focus on completeness
- Ensure clarity
- Include examples
- Maintain consistency

For README plans, generate a detailed outline covering: Project Overview, Installation, Usage, Configuration, Development guidelines.

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present documentation plan for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION EXECUTION

Once approved, execute the plan using all DOCUMENTATION_SAFEGUARDS.

---

## SUCCESS VALIDATION

Verify documentation is:

- Accurate (matches actual code)
- Complete (covers all public APIs)
- Helpful (includes examples)

README-specific checks:

- [ ] **Accurate**: All instructions work
- [ ] **Comprehensive**: Covers all setup needs
- [ ] **Helpful**: New users can get started
- [ ] **Tested**: Commands verified to work

Document under `## Documentation Validation`.

---

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Accuracy-first approach**: Verify every documented feature with actual code
- **User-focused content**: Organize documentation based on user needs
- **Example-driven documentation**: Include practical examples and usage scenarios
- **Consistency maintenance**: Follow established documentation patterns
- **No assumptions**: Always verify behavior before documenting

### README Guidelines

- **User-first approach**: Organize content for new users; start with what the project does and why; provide clear getting-started path
- **Verified instructions**: Test all setup and installation instructions; include exact commands that work; document version requirements
- **Practical examples**: Include working examples users can follow; show common use cases; provide copy-pasteable code snippets
- **No assumptions**: Don't assume user knowledge; explain acronyms and domain terms; link to prerequisite documentation

**⚠️ MUST READ:** CLAUDE.md for code pattern examples (backend/frontend) when writing code documentation. See `docs/claude/` for existing documentation structure.

## Anti-Hallucination Protocols

### ASSUMPTION_VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT

Before every major operation:

1. "What assumptions am I making about [X]?"
2. "Have I verified this with actual code evidence?"

### EVIDENCE_CHAIN_VALIDATION

Before claiming any relationship:

- "I believe X calls Y because..." → show actual code
- "This follows pattern Z because..." → cite specific examples

### TOOL_EFFICIENCY_PROTOCOL

- Batch multiple Grep searches into single calls with OR patterns
- Use parallel Read operations for related files

### CONTEXT_ANCHOR_SYSTEM

Every 10 operations:

1. Re-read the original task description
2. Verify the current operation aligns with original goals

- `changelog`
- `release-notes`

### Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
