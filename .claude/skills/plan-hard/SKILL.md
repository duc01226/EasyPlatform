> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before executing.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Research, analyze the codebase, and create a detailed phased implementation plan with user collaboration.

**Workflow:**

1. **Pre-Check** — Detect active/suggested plan or create new directory
2. **Research** — Parallel researcher subagents explore different aspects (max 5 tool calls each)
3. **Codebase Analysis** — Read codebase-summary.md, code-standards.md, system-architecture.md; scout if needed
4. **Plan Creation** — Planner subagent creates plan.md + phase-XX files with full sections
5. **Post-Validation** — Optionally interview user to confirm decisions via /plan-validate

**Key Rules:**

- PLANNING ONLY: do NOT implement or execute code changes
- Always run /plan-review after plan creation
- Ask user to confirm before any next step
- Research reports <=150 lines; plan.md <=80 lines
- **External Memory**: Write all research and analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE analysis file before generating plan.

Activate `planning` skill.

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the `EnterPlanMode` tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS run `/plan-review` to validate the plan.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

## Your mission

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:

- If "Plan:" shows a path -> Active plan exists. Ask user: "Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path -> Branch-matched hint only. Ask if they want to activate or create new.
- If "Plan: none" -> Create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow

1. If creating new: Create directory using `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section, then run `node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}`
   If reusing: Use the active plan path from Plan Context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Use multiple `researcher` agents (max 2 agents) in parallel to research for this task:
   Each agent research for a different aspect of the task and are allowed to perform max 5 tool calls.
4. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
   **ONLY PERFORM THIS FOLLOWING STEP IF `codebase-summary.md` is not available or older than 3 days**: Use `/scout <instructions>` slash command to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
5. Main agent gathers all research and scout report filepaths, and pass them to `planner` subagent with the prompt to create an implementation plan of this task.
6. Main agent receives the implementation plan from `planner` subagent, and ask user to review the plan

## Post-Plan Validation (Optional)

After plan creation, offer validation interview to confirm decisions before implementation.

**Check `## Plan Context` -> `Validation: mode=X, questions=MIN-MAX`:**

| Mode     | Behavior                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt` | Ask user: "Validate this plan with a brief interview?" -> Yes (Recommended) / No |
| `auto`   | Automatically execute `/plan-validate {plan-path}`                               |
| `off`    | Skip validation step entirely                                                    |

**If mode is `prompt`:** Use `AskUserQuestion` tool with options above.
**If user chooses validation or mode is `auto`:** Execute `/plan-validate {plan-path}` SlashCommand.

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure** (use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section)

```
{plan-dir}/
├── research/
│   ├── researcher-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── reports/
│   ├── XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── scout/
│   ├── scout-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md
├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
└── ...
```

**Research Output Requirements**

- Ensure every research markdown report remains concise (<=150 lines) while covering all requested topics and citations.

**Plan File Specification**

- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: '{Brief title}'
    description: '{One sentence for card preview}'
    status: pending
    priority: P2
    effort: { sum of phases, e.g., 4h }
    branch: { current git branch }
    tags: [relevant, tags]
    created: { YYYY-MM-DD }
    ---
    ```

- Save overview at `{plan-dir}/plan.md` (<80 lines): list each phase with status, progress, and links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` with sections: Context links, Overview, Key Insights, Requirements, **Alternatives Considered** (minimum 2 approaches with pros/cons), **Design Rationale** (WHY chosen approach), Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps.

## **IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
- **MANDATORY FINAL TASKS:** After creating all planning todo tasks, ALWAYS add these two final tasks:
  1. **Task: "Run /plan-validate"** — Trigger `/plan-validate` skill to interview the user with critical questions and validate plan assumptions
  2. **Task: "Run /plan-review"** — Trigger `/plan-review` skill to auto-review plan for validity, correctness, and best practices

## Important Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## REMINDER — Planning-Only Command

> **DO NOT** use `EnterPlanMode` tool.
> **DO NOT** start implementing.
> **ALWAYS** validate with `/plan-review` after plan creation.
> **ASK** user to confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
> **ASK** user decision questions with your recommendations when multiple approaches exist.
