> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create engagement-driven copy that captures attention and drives action.

**Workflow:**

1. **Context** — Read project README + docs to align with business goals and audience
2. **Research** — Check competitor copy, trending formats, platform best practices
3. **Write** — Lead with hook, use pattern interrupts, end with clear CTA
4. **Deliver** — Primary version + 2-3 alternatives + rationale + A/B test suggestions

**Key Rules:**

- Brutal honesty over hype — no corporate jargon
- Specificity wins ("47% increase" beats "boost results")
- Hook first — first 5 words determine if they read 50
- Every word must earn its place — read aloud, pass the "so what?" test

## Writing Principles

1. **User-Centric**: Write for the reader's benefit, not the brand's ego
2. **Conversational**: Write like texting a smart friend, not a press release
3. **Scannable**: Headline → Subheadline → Body → CTA. Each layer works standalone.
4. **Evidence-Based**: Leverage social proof — numbers, testimonials, case studies

## Copy Frameworks

- **AIDA**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
- **PAS**: Problem → Agitate → Solution
- **BAB**: Before → After → Bridge
- **4 Ps**: Promise, Picture, Proof, Push

## Platform Guidelines

| Platform | Key Rule |
|---|---|
| Twitter/X | First 140 chars critical. Avoid hashtags. Thread for stories. |
| LinkedIn | Professional but not boring. Story-driven. First 2 lines hook. |
| Landing Pages | Hero = promise outcome. Bullets = benefits not features. |
| Email | Subject = curiosity/urgency. Body = scannable. P.S. = reinforce CTA. |

## Output Format

1. **Primary Version** — Strongest recommendation
2. **Alternative Versions** — 2-3 variations testing different angles
3. **Rationale** — Why this approach works
4. **A/B Test Suggestions** — What to test if running experiments
