> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Teach Claude lessons that persist across sessions by saving to the most relevant reference doc.

**Workflow:**
1. **Capture** -- Identify the lesson from user instruction or experience
2. **Route** -- Analyze lesson content and select the best target file (see routing table)
3. **Save** -- Append lesson to the selected file
4. **Confirm** -- Acknowledge what was saved and where

**Key Rules:**
- Triggers on "remember this", "always do X", "never do Y"
- Smart-route to the most relevant file, NOT always `docs/lessons.md`
- Check for existing entries before creating duplicates
- Confirm target file with user before writing

# Lesson Learning Skill

Teach Claude lessons that persist across sessions. Lessons are smart-routed to the most relevant reference doc and automatically injected into prompts and before file edits.

## Usage

### Add a lesson

```
/learn always use the validation framework fluent API instead of throwing ValidationException
/learn never call external APIs in command handlers - use Entity Event Handlers
/learn prefer async/await over .then() chains
```

### List lessons

```
/learn list
```

### Remove a lesson

```
/learn remove 3
```

### Clear all lessons

```
/learn clear
```

## Smart File Routing (CRITICAL)

When saving a lesson, analyze its content and route to the **most relevant file**:

| If lesson is about... | Route to | Section hint |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Code review rules, anti-patterns, review checklists, YAGNI/KISS/DRY, naming conventions, review process | `docs/code-review-rules.md` | Add to most relevant section (anti-patterns, rules, checklists) |
| Backend C# patterns: CQRS, repositories, entities, validation, message bus, background jobs, migrations, EF Core, MongoDB | `docs/backend-patterns-reference.md` | Add to relevant section or Anti-Patterns section |
| Frontend Angular/TS patterns: components, stores, forms, API services, BEM, RxJS, directives, pipes | `docs/frontend-patterns-reference.md` | Add to relevant section or Anti-Patterns section |
| Integration tests: test base classes, fixtures, test helpers, test patterns, assertions | `docs/integration-test-reference.md` | Add to relevant section |
| General lessons, workflow tips, tooling, AI behavior, project conventions, anything not matching above | `docs/lessons.md` | Append as dated list entry |

### Prevention Depth Assessment (MANDATORY before saving)

Before saving any lesson, critically evaluate whether a doc update alone is sufficient or a deeper prevention mechanism is needed:

| Prevention Layer | When to use | Example |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Doc update only** | One-off awareness, rare edge case, team convention | "Always use fluent validation API" → `docs/backend-patterns-reference.md` |
| **Prompt rule** (`development-rules.md`) | Rule that ALL agents must follow on every task | "Grep after bulk edits" → `.claude/workflows/development-rules.md` |
| **Hook** (`.claude/hooks/`) | Automated enforcement, must never be forgotten | "Dedup markers must match" → `lib/dedup-constants.cjs` + consistency test |
| **Test** (`.claude/hooks/tests/`) | Regression prevention, verifiable invariant | "All hooks import from shared module" → test in `test-all-hooks.cjs` |
| **Skill update** (`.claude/skills/`) | Workflow step that should always include this check | "Review changes must check doc staleness" → skill SKILL.md update |

**Decision flow:**

1. **Capture** the lesson
2. **Ask:** "Could this mistake recur if the AI forgets this lesson?" If yes → needs more than a doc update
3. **Ask:** "Can this be caught automatically by a test or hook?" If yes → recommend hook/test
4. **Present options to user** with `AskUserQuestion`:
   - "Doc update only" — save to the best-fit reference file (default for most lessons)
   - "Doc + prompt rule" — also add to `development-rules.md` so all agents see it
   - "Full prevention" — plan a hook, test, or shared module to enforce it automatically
5. **Execute** the chosen option. For "Full prevention", create a plan via `/plan` instead of just saving.

### Routing Decision Process

1. **Read the lesson text** — identify keywords and domain
2. **Run Prevention Depth Assessment** — determine if doc-only or deeper prevention needed
3. **Match against routing table** — pick the best-fit file
4. **Tell the user:** "This lesson fits best in `docs/{file}`. Confirm? [Y/n]"
5. **On confirm** — read target file, find the right section, append the lesson
6. **On reject** — ask user which file to use instead

### Format by Target File

**For `docs/lessons.md`** (general lessons):
```markdown
- [YYYY-MM-DD] <lesson text>
```

**For pattern/rules files** (code-review-rules, backend-patterns, frontend-patterns, integration-test):
- Find the most relevant existing section in the file
- Append the lesson as a rule, anti-pattern entry, or code example
- Use the file's existing format (tables, code blocks, bullet lists)
- If no section fits, append to the Anti-Patterns or general rules section

## Budget Enforcement (MANDATORY for `docs/lessons.md`)

`docs/lessons.md` is injected into EVERY prompt and EVERY file edit. Token budget must be controlled.

**Hard limit:** 3000 characters (~1000 tokens). Check BEFORE saving any new lesson.

**Workflow when adding to `docs/lessons.md`:**

1. Read file, count characters (`wc -c docs/lessons.md`)
2. If current + new lesson > 3000 chars → trigger **Budget Trim** before saving
3. If under budget → save normally

**Budget Trim process:**

1. Display all current lessons with char count each
2. Evaluate each lesson on two axes:
   - **Universality** — How often does this apply? (every session vs rare edge case)
   - **Recurrence risk** — How likely is the AI to repeat this mistake without the reminder?
3. Score each: **HIGH** (keep as-is), **MEDIUM** (candidate to condense), **LOW** (candidate to remove)
4. Present to user with `AskUserQuestion`: "Budget exceeded. Recommend removing/condensing these LOW/MEDIUM items: [list]. Approve?"
5. On approval: condense MEDIUM items (shorten wording), remove LOW items, then save new lesson
6. On rejection: ask user which to remove/condense

**Condensing rules:**
- Remove examples, keep the rule: `"Patterns like X break Y syntax"` → just state the rule
- Merge related lessons into one if they share the same root cause
- Target: each lesson ≤ 250 chars (one concise sentence + bold title)

**Does NOT apply to:** Other routing targets (`backend-patterns-reference.md`, `code-review-rules.md`, etc.) — those files have their own size and are injected contextually, not on every prompt.

## Behavior

1. **`/learn <text>`** — Route and append lesson to the best-fit file (check budget if target is `lessons.md`)
2. **`/learn list`** — Read and display lessons from ALL 5 target files (show file grouping + char count for `lessons.md`)
3. **`/learn remove <N>`** — Remove lesson from `docs/lessons.md` by line number
4. **`/learn clear`** — Clear all lessons from `docs/lessons.md` only (confirm first)
5. **`/learn trim`** — Manually trigger Budget Trim on `docs/lessons.md`
6. **File creation** — If target file doesn't exist, create with header only

## Auto-Inferred Activation

When Claude detects correction phrases in conversation (e.g., "always use X", "remember this", "never do Y", "from now on"), this skill auto-activates via `infer: true`. When auto-inferred (not explicit `/learn`), **confirm with the user before saving**: "Save this as a lesson? [Y/n]"

## Storage

Lessons are distributed across 5 files:

| File | Content type |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `docs/code-review-rules.md` | Review rules, anti-patterns, conventions |
| `docs/backend-patterns-reference.md` | Backend C# patterns and rules |
| `docs/frontend-patterns-reference.md` | Frontend Angular/TS patterns and rules |
| `docs/integration-test-reference.md` | Test patterns and rules |
| `docs/lessons.md` | General lessons (fallback) |

## Injection

Lessons are injected by `lessons-injector.cjs` hook on:

- **UserPromptSubmit** — `docs/lessons.md` content (with dedup)
- **PreToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit)** — `docs/lessons.md` content (always)
- Pattern reference files are injected by their respective hooks (`code-patterns-injector.cjs`, `code-review-rules-injector.cjs`, etc.)
