> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before executing.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze codebase and create a structured implementation plan without writing any code.

**Workflow:**

1. **Check Plan Context** — Reuse active plan or create new directory per naming convention
2. **Analyze Codebase** — Read `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md`
3. **Create Plan** — Generate `plan.md` + `phase-XX-*.md` files with YAML frontmatter
4. **Validate** — Run `/plan-review` and ask user to confirm before implementation

**Key Rules:**

- Do NOT use `EnterPlanMode` tool; do NOT implement any code
- Collaborate with user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations
- Always validate plan with `/plan-review` after creation

Activate `planning` skill.

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the `EnterPlanMode` tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS run `/plan-review` to validate the plan.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

## Your mission

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:

- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched hint only. Ask if they want to activate or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow

Use `planner` subagent to:

1. If creating new: Create directory using `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section, then run `node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}`
   If reusing: Use the active plan path from Plan Context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
   3.5. **External Memory**: Write analysis findings to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read this file before creating the plan.
4. Gathers all information and create an implementation plan of this task.
5. Ask user to review the plan.

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure** (use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section)

```
{plan-dir}/
├── reports/
│   ├── XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md
├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
└── ...
```

**Plan File Specification**

- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: '{Brief title}'
    description: '{One sentence for card preview}'
    status: pending
    priority: P2
    effort: { sum of phases, e.g., 4h }
    branch: { current git branch }
    tags: [relevant, tags]
    created: { YYYY-MM-DD }
    ---
    ```

- Save the overview access point at `{plan-dir}/plan.md`. Keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each implementation phase with status and progress plus links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` containing the following sections in order: Context links (reference parent plan, dependencies, docs), Overview (date, description, priority, implementation status, review status), Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps.

## **IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
- **MANDATORY FINAL TASKS:** After creating all planning todo tasks, ALWAYS add these two final tasks:
  1. **Task: "Run /plan-validate"** — Trigger `/plan-validate` skill to interview the user with critical questions and validate plan assumptions
  2. **Task: "Run /plan-review"** — Trigger `/plan-review` skill to auto-review plan for validity, correctness, and best practices

## Post-Plan Validation

After plan creation, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask: "Want me to run `/plan-review` to validate, or proceed to implementation?" with options:

- "Run /plan-review (Recommended)" — Execute `/plan-review` to validate the plan
- "Proceed to implementation" — Skip validation and start implementing

## Important Notes

- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token consumption efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## REMINDER — Planning-Only Command

> **DO NOT** use `EnterPlanMode` tool.
> **DO NOT** start implementing.
> **ALWAYS** validate with `/plan-review` after plan creation.
> **ASK** user to confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
> **ASK** user decision questions with your recommendations when multiple approaches exist.
