> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Deep-dive into top sources, extract key findings, cross-validate claims, build structured evidence base.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read source map** — Load output from web-research step
2. **Fetch top sources** — WebFetch top 5-8 Tier 1-2 sources
3. **Extract findings** — Pull key facts, data points, quotes
4. **Cross-validate** — Compare findings across sources
5. **Build evidence base** — Structured findings with confidence scores

**Key Rules:**

- Maximum 8 WebFetch calls per invocation
- Every finding must cite specific source
- Conflicting claims → present both, flag discrepancy

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Deep Research

## Step 1: Load Source Map

Read the source map from `.claude/tmp/_sources-{slug}.md` (output of web-research step).

Prioritize sources for deep-dive:

1. Tier 1-2 sources first
2. High-relevance sources
3. Sources covering identified gaps

## Step 2: Fetch Top Sources

For each priority source (max 8):

1. Run `WebFetch` with the URL
2. Extract: key claims, data points, quotes, methodology
3. Note: publication date, author credentials, source type

## Step 3: Extract Findings

For each source, extract:

- **Key claims** — factual statements with specific data
- **Data points** — numbers, percentages, dates
- **Quotes** — notable expert statements
- **Methodology** — how data was gathered (for market reports)

## Step 4: Cross-Validate

Compare findings across sources:

- **Agreement** — 2+ sources say the same thing → high confidence
- **Discrepancy** — sources disagree → note both positions
- **Unique** — only 1 source → mark as "single source, unverified"

## Step 5: Build Evidence Base

Write to `.claude/tmp/_evidence-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Evidence Base: {Topic}

**Date:** {date}
**Sources analyzed:** {count}

## Findings

### Finding 1: {Title}

**Confidence:** {95%|80%|60%|<60%}
**Sources:** [1], [3]
**Content:** {finding with inline citations}
**Cross-validation:** {agreement/discrepancy notes}

## Unresolved Discrepancies

- {claim X from source A vs claim Y from source B}

## Gaps Remaining

- {what couldn't be verified}
```

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `research` workflow** (Recommended) — web-research → deep-research → synthesis → review
> 2. **Execute `/deep-research` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/business-evaluation (Recommended)"** — Evaluate business viability from research
- **"/knowledge-synthesis"** — If synthesizing research report
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.

  <!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.
      <!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.
      <!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses
