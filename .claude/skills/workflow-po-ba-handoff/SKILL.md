> **[IMPORTANT]** This skill activates a full workflow. You MUST create todo tasks for ALL steps and execute them in sequence. Do NOT skip any step.

Activate the `po-ba-handoff` workflow. Run `/workflow-start po-ba-handoff` with the user's prompt as context.

**Steps:** /idea → /review-artifact → /handoff → /refine → /refine-review → /story → /story-review → /pbi-challenge → /dor-gate → /pbi-mockup → /workflow-end

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
