## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed visual report.

> **For individual page/component testing with Playwright scripts, use `webapp-testing` instead.**

**Workflow:**

1. **Discover** — Browse target URL, discover all pages, components, endpoints
2. **Plan Tests** — Create test plan covering accessibility, responsiveness, performance, security, SEO
3. **Execute** — Run parallel tester subagents; capture screenshots for each test area
4. **Analyze** — Use visual analysis tooling to review screenshots and visual elements
5. **Report** — Generate Markdown report with embedded screenshots and recommendations

**Key Rules:**

- Test and report only — never implement fixes (this is a testing/reporting skill)
- Save all screenshots in the report directory
- Support authenticated routes via cookie/token/localStorage injection

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

**Pre-read (design system):** Load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so visual/style assertions reference real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) instead of guesses.

Activate the browser automation tooling.

## Purpose

Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed report.

## Arguments

- $1: URL - The URL of the website to test
- $2: OPTIONS - Optional test configuration (e.g., --headless, --mobile, --auth)

## Testing Protected Routes (Authentication)

For testing protected routes that require authentication, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: User Manual Login

Instruct the user to:

1. Open the target site in their browser
2. Log in manually with their credentials
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies/Storage

### Step 2: Extract Auth Credentials

Ask the user to provide one of:

- **Cookies**: Copy cookie values (name, value, domain)
- **Access Token**: Copy JWT/Bearer token from localStorage or cookies
- **Session Storage**: Copy relevant session keys

### Step 3: Inject Authentication

Use the available browser automation runner to inject credentials before testing:

```bash
# Cookies
# Add cookies before navigating to protected pages.

# Bearer token
# Set the Authorization header or localStorage token key before navigation.

# Local/session storage
# Populate the required storage keys, then reload the page.
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

After auth injection, the browser session persists. Run tests normally with the available browser automation runner:

```bash
# Navigate and screenshot protected pages.
# Save outputs in the report directory for later analysis.
```

### Auth Script Options

- `--cookies '<json>'` - Inject cookies (JSON array)
- `--token '<token>'` - Inject Bearer token
- `--token-key '<key>'` - localStorage key for token (default: access_token)
- `--header '<name>'` - Set HTTP header with token (e.g., Authorization)
- `--local-storage '<json>'` - Inject localStorage items
- `--session-storage '<json>'` - Inject sessionStorage items
- `--reload true` - Reload page after injection
- `--clear true` - Clear saved auth session

## Workflow

- Use `plan` skill to organize the test plan & report in the current project directory.
- All the screenshots should be saved in the same report directory.
- Browse $URL with the specified $OPTIONS, discover all pages, components, and endpoints.
- Create a test plan based on the discovered structure
- Use multiple `tester` subagents or tool calls in parallel to test all pages, forms, navigation, user flows, accessibility, functionalities, usability, responsive layouts, cross-browser compatibility, performance, security, seo, etc.
- Use `visual analysis tooling` to analyze all screenshots and visual elements.
- Generate a comprehensive report in Markdown format, embedding all screenshots directly in the report.
- Finally respond to the user with a concise summary of findings and recommendations.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to preview the report with `/preview` slash command.

## Output Requirements

How to write reports:

- Format: Use clear, structured Markdown with headers, lists, and code blocks where appropriate
- Include the test results summary, key findings, and screenshot references
- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**IMPORTANT**: Stop at testing and reporting — do not start implementing the fixes.
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof, confidence >80%.
- **Evidence:** cite `file:line` for every claim; never speculate.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ `CLAUDE.md` before starting

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
