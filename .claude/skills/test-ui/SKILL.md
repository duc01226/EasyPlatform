## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed visual report.

> **For individual page/component testing with Playwright scripts, use `webapp-testing` instead.**

**Workflow:**

1. **Discover** — Browse target URL, discover all pages, components, endpoints
2. **Plan Tests** — Create test plan covering accessibility, responsiveness, performance, security, SEO
3. **Execute** — Run parallel tester subagents; capture screenshots for each test area
4. **Analyze** — Use visual analysis tooling to review screenshots and visual elements
5. **Report** — Generate Markdown report with embedded screenshots and recommendations

**Key Rules:**

- Test and report only — never implement fixes (this is a testing/reporting skill)
- Save all screenshots in the report directory
- Support authenticated routes via cookie/token/localStorage injection

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

**Pre-read (design system):** Load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so visual/style assertions reference real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) instead of guesses.

Activate the browser automation tooling.

## Purpose

Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed report.

## Arguments

- $1: URL - The URL of the website to test
- $2: OPTIONS - Optional test configuration (e.g., --headless, --mobile, --auth)

## Testing Protected Routes (Authentication)

For testing protected routes that require authentication, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: User Manual Login

Instruct the user to:

1. Open the target site in their browser
2. Log in manually with their credentials
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies/Storage

### Step 2: Extract Auth Credentials

Ask the user to provide one of:

- **Cookies**: Copy cookie values (name, value, domain)
- **Access Token**: Copy JWT/Bearer token from localStorage or cookies
- **Session Storage**: Copy relevant session keys

### Step 3: Inject Authentication

Use the available browser automation runner to inject credentials before testing:

```bash
# Cookies
# Add cookies before navigating to protected pages.

# Bearer token
# Set the Authorization header or localStorage token key before navigation.

# Local/session storage
# Populate the required storage keys, then reload the page.
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

After auth injection, the browser session persists. Run tests normally with the available browser automation runner:

```bash
# Navigate and screenshot protected pages.
# Save outputs in the report directory for later analysis.
```

### Auth Script Options

- `--cookies '<json>'` - Inject cookies (JSON array)
- `--token '<token>'` - Inject Bearer token
- `--token-key '<key>'` - localStorage key for token (default: access_token)
- `--header '<name>'` - Set HTTP header with token (e.g., Authorization)
- `--local-storage '<json>'` - Inject localStorage items
- `--session-storage '<json>'` - Inject sessionStorage items
- `--reload true` - Reload page after injection
- `--clear true` - Clear saved auth session

## Workflow

- Use `plan` skill to organize the test plan & report in the current project directory.
- All the screenshots should be saved in the same report directory.
- Browse $URL with the specified $OPTIONS, discover all pages, components, and endpoints.
- Create a test plan based on the discovered structure
- Use multiple `tester` subagents or tool calls in parallel to test all pages, forms, navigation, user flows, accessibility, functionalities, usability, responsive layouts, cross-browser compatibility, performance, security, seo, etc.
- Use `visual analysis tooling` to analyze all screenshots and visual elements.
- Generate a comprehensive report in Markdown format, embedding all screenshots directly in the report.
- Finally respond to the user with a concise summary of findings and recommendations.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to preview the report with `/preview` slash command.

## Output Requirements

How to write reports:

- Format: Use clear, structured Markdown with headers, lists, and code blocks where appropriate
- Include the test results summary, key findings, and screenshot references
- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**IMPORTANT**: Stop at testing and reporting — do not start implementing the fixes.
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)

> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
