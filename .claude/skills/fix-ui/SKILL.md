> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix UI/UX issues including layout, styling, responsiveness, and visual bugs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Locate the component/template causing the visual issue
2. **Diagnose** — Trace CSS/HTML/component logic to find root cause
3. **Fix** — Apply targeted fix (SCSS, template, component logic)
4. **Verify** — Check responsive behavior and cross-browser rendering

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Always use BEM classes on template elements
- Check responsive breakpoints when fixing layout issues

**Pre-read (design system):** Load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so fixes use real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) and canonical component classes — not invented values.

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

<!-- /SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

## Required Skills (Priority Order)

1. **`ui-ux-pro-max`** - Design intelligence database
2. **`web-design-guidelines`** - Design principles
3. **`frontend-design`** - Implementation patterns

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After identifying UI root cause, MUST ATTENTION present findings + proposed fix to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to read and analyze `./docs/design-guidelines.md` then fix the following issues:
<issue>$ARGUMENTS</issue>

## Workflow

**FIRST**: Run `ui-ux-pro-max` searches to understand context and common issues:

```bash
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product-type>" --domain product
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<style-keywords>" --domain style
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "accessibility" --domain ux
python3 $HOME/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "z-index animation" --domain ux
```

If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.

1. Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the fix step by step.
2. Use screenshot capture tools along with `ai-multimodal` skill to take screenshots of the implemented fix (at the exact parent container, don't take screenshot of the whole page) and use the appropriate Gemini analysis skills (`ai-multimodal`, `video-analysis`, or `document-extraction`) to analyze those outputs so the result matches the design guideline and addresses all issues.

- If the issues are not addressed, repeat the process until all issues are addressed.

3. Use `chrome-devtools` skill to analyze the implemented fix and make sure it matches the design guideline.
4. Use `tester` agent to test the fix and compile the code to make sure it works, then report back to main agent.

- If there are issues or failed tests, ask main agent to fix all of them and repeat the process until all tests pass.

5. Project Management & Documentation:
   **If user approves the changes:** Use `project-manager` and `docs-manager` subagents in parallel to update the project progress and documentation:
    - Use `project-manager` subagent to update the project progress and task status in the given plan file.
    - Use `docs-manager` subagent to update the docs in `./docs` directory if needed.
    - Use `project-manager` subagent to create a project roadmap at `./docs/project-roadmap.md` file.
    - **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing outputs.
      **If user rejects the changes:** Ask user to explain the issues and ask main agent to fix all of them and repeat the process.
6. Final Report:

- Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.
- Ask the user if they want to commit and push to git repository, if yes, use `git-manager` subagent to commit and push to git repository.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**REMEMBER**:

- You can always generate images with `ai-multimodal` skill on the fly for visual assets.
- You always read and analyze the generated assets with `ai-multimodal` skill to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use `media-processing` skill as needed.
- **IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

- **After fixing, MUST ATTENTION run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.
