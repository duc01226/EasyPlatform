> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

**Prerequisites:** (inline summary + read instruction for each protocol)

> **Understand Code First** — Search codebase for 3+ similar implementations BEFORE writing any code. Read existing files, validate assumptions with grep evidence, map dependencies via graph trace. Never invent new patterns when existing ones work.
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` for full protocol and checklists.

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs `file:line` proof. Confidence: >95% recommend freely, 80-94% with caveats, <80% DO NOT recommend — gather more evidence. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes.
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` for full protocol and checklists.

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
