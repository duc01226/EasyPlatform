Find the Angular component(s) matching this screenshot: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Match screenshots to existing Angular components in the codebase for code reuse.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze** — Process screenshot with vision capabilities
2. **Search** — Grep/glob for matching component patterns in frontend source directories
3. **Match** — Return component paths with similarity assessment

**Key Rules:**

- Auto-activated when user provides UI screenshots
- Search shared component library, domain libraries, and app-specific components
- Report exact component file paths and usage examples

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Prerequisites

- **MUST READ** `references/anti-hallucination-protocol.md` before any output
- **MUST READ** `references/matching-algorithm.md` for the 6-step protocol

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Component Index

Read `docs/component-index.json`. If missing or stale, regenerate:

```bash
# Full scan — rebuild entire index from all source files
python .claude/skills/visual-component-finder/scripts/build-component-index.py

# Incremental — only re-index files changed since last commit (fast)
python .claude/skills/visual-component-finder/scripts/build-component-index.py --git-changes

# Incremental — changes since a specific branch/ref
python .claude/skills/visual-component-finder/scripts/build-component-index.py --git-changes main
```

**When to use which:**

- `--git-changes` — after pulling new code or switching branches (seconds, not minutes)
- No flag (full scan) — first-time build, or when index seems corrupted/stale

### Step 2: Analyze Screenshot

Use the Read tool on the screenshot image. Extract visual fingerprint:

- Visible text (headers, labels, button text, table columns)
- Layout pattern (sidebar+content, table, form, card grid, modal)
- URL path (if browser bar visible)
- BEM class patterns (if DevTools open)
- App identification (detect from project config, URL, or port mapping)

### Step 3: Match Components

Follow the **Signal Checklist** in `references/matching-algorithm.md`:

- Check 6 boolean signals (S1-S6) against index
- Calculate confidence from signal count
- If 0-1 signals matched, run Live Grep Fallback (Step 6)

### Step 4: Generate Component Graph

Follow `references/component-graph-template.md` to output Mermaid relationship diagram.

### Step 5: Output Results

Report with: matched component(s), confidence %, evidence per signal, file paths, relationship graph.

## Disambiguation

- Intent is to **find/modify existing** code → THIS skill
- Intent is to **create new** UI from screenshot → defer to `design-screenshot`
- Intent is to **describe** a design → defer to `design-describe`

## Workflow Positioning

When attached to bugfix/feature/refactor prompts, this skill runs **before** `/scout`.

## Important Notes

- Every match MUST cite `file:line` evidence — see anti-hallucination protocol
- Show ranked candidates when confidence <85%
- Detect reusable components (in `libs/`) and trace to page consumers
- Index covers all frontend application versions

---

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
