## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create structured UI/UX design specification documents from requirements or PBIs for developer handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read Source** — Extract UI requirements from PBI, story, or Figma URL
2. **Determine Complexity** — Quick Spec (sections 1-4) vs Full Spec (all 7 sections)
3. **Build Component Inventory** — List new vs existing components
4. **Define States & Tokens** — Interactions, design tokens, responsive breakpoints
5. **Save Artifact** — Output to `team-artifacts/design-specs/`

**Key Rules:**

- If Figma URL provided → auto-routes to `/figma-design` for context extraction
- If wireframe image provided → auto-routes to `/wireframe-to-spec` for structured analysis
- If screenshot provided → uses `ai-multimodal` for design extraction
- Reference existing design system tokens from `docs/project-reference/design-system/`
- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Include accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, contrast)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Design Specification

Create structured UI/UX design specification documents from requirements or PBIs for developer handoff.

## When to Use

- A PBI or user story needs a design spec before implementation
- Translating requirements into concrete UI layout, states, and tokens
- Documenting component inventory and interaction patterns
- Creating responsive breakpoint specifications

## When NOT to Use

- This skill auto-routes Figma URLs to `/figma-design` and wireframes to `/wireframe-to-spec` — no need to call those skills separately
- Building the actual UI -- use `frontend-design`
- Full UX research and design process -- use `ux-designer`
- Reviewing existing UI code -- use `web-design-guidelines`

## Prerequisites

Read before executing:

- The source PBI, user story, or requirements document
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/` -- project design tokens (if applicable)
- Existing design specs in `team-artifacts/design-specs/` for format consistency

### Frontend/UI Context

When this task involves frontend or UI changes, **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/ui-system-context.md` and the following docs:

- Frontend patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

## Workflow

1. **Read source input & route by type**

    | Input Detected           | Detection                                      | Action                                                                   |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Figma URL                | `figma.com/design` or `figma.com/file` in text | Activate `/figma-design` to extract context, then continue               |
    | Image/screenshot         | Image file attached to prompt                  | Use `ai-multimodal` to extract design guidelines, then continue          |
    | Hand-drawn wireframe     | Image + "wireframe"/"sketch" keyword           | Activate `/wireframe-to-spec` to generate structured spec, then continue |
    | PBI/story text           | Acceptance criteria present                    | Extract UI requirements from text, continue                              |
    | Verbal/text requirements | No image, no URL, no PBI                       | Clarify with user, then continue                                         |

    For ANY visual input: extract design context FIRST, then proceed to spec generation.

2. **Determine spec complexity**

    ```
    IF single form or simple component → Quick Spec (sections 1-4 only)
    IF full page or multi-component view → Full Spec (all 7 sections)
    IF multi-page flow → Full Spec + Flow Diagram
    ```

3. **Build component inventory**
    - List all UI components needed
    - Identify reusable vs feature-specific components
    - Note existing components from shared component library or design system

4. **Define states and interactions**
    - Default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading, empty states
    - User interactions (click, drag, keyboard shortcuts)
    - Transitions and animations

5. **Extract design tokens**
    - Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, border-radius
    - Reference existing design system tokens where possible

6. **Document responsive behavior**
    - Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
    - What changes at each breakpoint (layout, visibility, sizing)

7. **Save artifact**
    - Path: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-designspec-{feature-slug}.md`

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

## Workflow Recommendation

> **IMPORTANT MUST:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user:
>
> 1. **Activate `design-workflow` workflow** (Recommended) — design-spec → code-review
> 2. **Execute `/design-spec` directly** — run this skill standalone
