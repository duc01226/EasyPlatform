## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create structured UI/UX design specification documents from requirements or PBIs for developer handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read Source** — Extract UI requirements from PBI, story, or Figma URL
2. **Determine Complexity** — Quick Spec (sections 1-4) vs Full Spec (all 7 sections)
3. **Build Component Inventory** — List new vs existing components
4. **Define States & Tokens** — Interactions, design tokens, responsive breakpoints
5. **Save Artifact** — Output to `team-artifacts/design-specs/`

**Key Rules:**

- If Figma URL provided → auto-routes to `/figma-design` for context extraction
- If wireframe image provided (hand-drawn/digital/tool-export) → handled internally via `--mode=wireframe` (see "Mode: wireframe" below)
- If screenshot provided → uses `visual analysis tooling` for design extraction
- Reference existing design system tokens from `docs/project-reference/design-system/`
- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)
- Include accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, contrast)
- **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic output:** spec prose/headings follow `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3 — describe components by UX role, not framework/library names; source paths and class names appear ONLY in evidence fields (`**Evidence**`, `[Source:]`), frontmatter, and Mermaid.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Design Specification

Create structured UI/UX design specification documents from requirements or PBIs for developer handoff.

## When to Use

- A PBI or user story needs a design spec before implementation
- Translating requirements into concrete UI layout, states, and tokens
- Documenting component inventory and interaction patterns
- Creating responsive breakpoint specifications

## When NOT to Use

- This skill auto-routes Figma URLs to `/figma-design`; wireframes are handled internally via `--mode=wireframe` — no need to call a separate skill
- Building the actual UI -- use `frontend-design`
- Reviewing existing UI code -- use `web-design-guidelines`

## Prerequisites

Read before executing:

- The source PBI, user story, or requirements document
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/` -- project design tokens (if applicable)
- Existing design specs in `team-artifacts/design-specs/` for format consistency

### Frontend/UI Context

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

- Frontend patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

## Workflow

1. **Read source input & route by type**

    | Input Detected           | Detection                                      | Action                                                                    |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Figma URL                | `figma.com/design` or `figma.com/file` in text | Activate `/figma-design` to extract context, then continue                |
    | Image/screenshot         | Image file attached to prompt                  | Use `visual analysis tooling` to extract design guidelines, then continue |
    | Hand-drawn wireframe     | Image + "wireframe"/"sketch" keyword           | Run `--mode=wireframe` (internal — see "Mode: wireframe" section)         |
    | PBI/story text           | Acceptance criteria present                    | Extract UI requirements from text, continue                               |
    | Verbal/text requirements | No image, no URL, no PBI                       | Clarify with user, then continue                                          |

For ANY visual input: extract design context FIRST, then proceed to spec generation.

2. **Determine spec complexity**

    ```
    IF single form or simple component → Quick Spec (sections 1-4 only)
    IF full page or multi-component view → Full Spec (all 7 sections)
    IF multi-page flow → Full Spec + Flow Diagram
    ```

3. **Build component inventory**
    - List all UI components needed
    - Identify reusable vs feature-specific components
    - Note existing components from shared component library or design system

4. **Define states and interactions**
    - Default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading, empty states
    - User interactions (click, drag, keyboard shortcuts)
    - Transitions and animations

5. **Extract design tokens**
    - Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, border-radius
    - Reference existing design system tokens where possible

6. **Document responsive behavior**
    - Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
    - What changes at each breakpoint (layout, visibility, sizing)

7. **Save artifact** — pick the filename variant by artifact type:
    - Design spec: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-designspec-{feature-slug}.md`
    - Accessibility audit: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-ux-audit-{feature-slug}.md`
    - Single-component doc: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-ux-component-{component-name}.md`

## Mode: wireframe (image → spec)

> **Invoke with `--mode=wireframe`** (or whenever a hand-drawn wireframe, digital wireframe, or UI sketch is the input). This mode is an INPUT adapter: it analyzes the image, then flows into the normal spec sections (Output Format) and the M1-M5 compliance gate. `design-spec` is the canonical owner of wireframe→spec conversion.

### Input Routing (wireframe)

| Input                   | Detection                               | Action                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hand-drawn sketch photo | Image with rough/organic lines          | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Digital wireframe       | Image with clean lines/shapes           | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Wireframe tool export   | Image from Excalidraw/Balsamiq/MockFlow | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Figma URL               | `figma.com` in text                     | Route to `/figma-design` instead             |
| App screenshot          | Polished UI with real data              | Route to `/design --mode=screenshot` instead |

### Wireframe Analysis

Use `visual analysis tooling` with these prompts:

**Prompt 1: Layout Extraction** — "Analyze this wireframe image. Identify: (1) page layout regions (header, sidebar, main, footer), (2) all UI elements with approximate position and type (button, input, table, card, dropdown, modal, tabs), (3) content hierarchy (what is primary vs secondary), (4) interactive elements, (5) any text labels or annotations, (6) navigation patterns."

**Prompt 2: Component Identification** — "From the wireframe, list every distinct UI component. For each: name it descriptively, classify its complexity (primitive=single element, composite=grouped elements, section=page region), note its purpose."

### Wireframe Output Generation

After image analysis, generate (per the `SYNC:ui-wireframe-protocol` block below):

1. **ASCII Wireframe** — Recreate layout using box-drawing characters
2. **Component Inventory** — List with tier classification (Common/Domain-Shared/Page)
3. **States Table** — Default, Loading, Empty, Error per view
4. **Component Decomposition Tree** — If detail level warrants (refine/story)
5. **Responsive Suggestions** — Based on layout complexity

Apply the **M1-M5 Compliance for UI Specs** gate (below) to all wireframe-derived prose: business-level component names, no code-prop refs, map to feature logic by logical ID, observable state transitions, rebuild-from-spec.

### Mapped Business Operations

Emit this table linking each interactive component to the feature operations/rules it drives (logical ID is the primary spine; mark `[UNVERIFIED — needs feature-spec mapping]` when the wireframe alone cannot determine it):

| Interactive Component | Interaction (observable) | Feature Operation / Rule (logical ID) | Notes                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Primary Button        | Click → submit form      | OP-XX                                 | Triggers create/update operation |
| Filter Dropdown       | Select → reload list     | OP-XX                                 | Drives query/search operation    |
| Row Action Menu       | Click → confirm dialog   | BR-XX                                 | Guarded by authorization rule    |

### Wireframe Output Formats

- **Format A: PBI Section (default)** — output a standalone `## UI Layout` section compatible with PBI/story templates (consumed by `/pbi-mockup`).
- **Format B: Standalone Spec** — output to `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-wireframe-spec-{slug}.md`.

### Confidence & Review (wireframe)

- **Always display confidence level** for wireframe interpretation (analysis is 70-80% accurate).
- **Always recommend human review** before proceeding to implementation.
- If confidence <70%: ask clarifying questions about ambiguous elements via `AskUserQuestion`.

## M1-M5 Compliance for UI Specs

See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for BLOCKING criteria. A UI spec MUST satisfy these before handoff:

- **M1 — Business-level component names.** Name every component by its UX role — Primary Button, Secondary Button, Modal Dialog, Data Table, Dropdown, Toast — NEVER by a framework component class name or library import. FAIL on tech-term prose.
- **M2 — No code-prop refs in prose.** Describe behavior and appearance in plain UX language. NEVER reference component-state props, CSS class names, framework directives, or selectors in prose. Those belong only in `**Evidence**`/`[Source:]` carriers, frontmatter, and Mermaid.
- **M3 — Cross-reference by logical ID.** For every behavior driven by feature logic, cite the driving operation or rule by its logical ID (`OP-`/`BR-`/`FR-`) — link UI behavior back to the feature spec, not to handler code. Keep any `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor strictly in the Evidence carrier — never physical code coordinates or repository-root paths.
- **M4 — Testable, unambiguous behavior.** Every state and interaction MUST have exactly one valid interpretation and an observable completion marker. Replace vague phrases ("handle appropriately", "show feedback") with the concrete observable result.
- **M5 — Rebuild-from-spec.** A reader with zero codebase knowledge MUST be able to rebuild this UI on ANY framework from the spec alone. If a marker is only resolvable by reading source, it fails M5 — restate it as a visual/textual observable.

### Observable State Definitions

Define every state by what a user can SEE (color, icon, position, text), the business meaning, and the operation/rule that triggers it — NEVER by CSS class or component-state prop:

| State    | Visual Markers (observable)                            | Business Meaning                           | Triggering Operation / Rule (logical ID) |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Default  | Primary fill color, enabled label, no spinner          | Action available to the actor              | OP-XX (entry state)                      |
| Loading  | Spinner icon replaces label, control non-interactive   | Operation in progress, awaiting result     | OP-XX (request submitted)                |
| Disabled | Muted/gray fill, label dimmed, no pointer affordance   | Precondition not met / actor not permitted | BR-XX (authorization or guard rule)      |
| Error    | Error-color border, inline message text, alert icon    | Operation rejected or validation failed    | BR-XX (validation rule)                  |
| Empty    | Placeholder illustration + guidance text, no data rows | No records exist for the current view      | OP-XX (query returned zero results)      |
| Success  | Confirmation toast/checkmark, updated visible data     | Operation completed and persisted          | OP-XX (operation succeeded)              |

## Component States Checklist

Every interactive component MUST document all 7 states by their **observable appearance and business meaning** — never by CSS class or framework prop (see M2):

- **Default** — resting appearance; action available to the actor
- **Hover** — pointer-over affordance change (cursor / elevation / color shift)
- **Active** — pressed/engaged feedback during interaction
- **Focus** — keyboard-focus indicator (visible ring/outline) for a11y traversal
- **Disabled** — muted/non-interactive; precondition or permission not met
- **Error** — validation/operation failure with inline message + alert affordance
- **Loading** — in-progress indicator (spinner / skeleton); control non-interactive

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Run the design sequence** (Recommended) — `/design-spec` → `/interface-design` (product UIs) or `/frontend-design` (marketing/creative) → `/workflow-review-changes`
> 2. **Execute `/design-spec` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
