> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Launch a visual plans dashboard with progress tracking, phase status, and timeline visualization.

**Workflow:**

1. **Invoke** — `/kanban` or `/kanban plans/` to view, `/kanban --stop` to stop
2. **Start Server** — Run `server.cjs` as background task with `run_in_background: true`
3. **Report URL** — Parse JSON output and display full URL (including query string) to user

**Key Rules:**

- Always run server as Claude Code background task (visible in `/tasks`)
- Never truncate URL to just host:port; display full path + query string
- Set `timeout: 300000` to prevent premature termination

Plans dashboard with progress tracking and timeline visualization.

## Usage

- `/kanban` - View dashboard for ./plans directory
- `/kanban plans/` - View dashboard for specific directory
- `/kanban --stop` - Stop running server

## Features

- Plan cards with progress bars
- Phase status breakdown (completed, in-progress, pending)
- Timeline/Gantt visualization
- Activity heatmap
- Issue and branch links

## Execution

**IMPORTANT:** Run server as Claude Code background task using `run_in_background: true` with the Bash tool. This makes the server visible in `/tasks` and manageable via `KillShell`.

Check if this script is located in the current workspace or in `$HOME/.claude/skills/plans-kanban` directory:

- If in current workspace: `$SKILL_DIR_PATH` = `./.claude/skills/plans-kanban/`
- If in home directory: `$SKILL_DIR_PATH` = `$HOME/.claude/skills/plans-kanban/`

### Stop Server

If `--stop` flag is provided:

```bash
node $SKILL_DIR_PATH/scripts/server.cjs --stop
```

### Start Server

Otherwise, run the kanban server as CC background task with `--foreground` flag (keeps process alive for CC task management):

```bash
# Determine plans directory
INPUT_DIR="{{dir}}"
PLANS_DIR="${INPUT_DIR:-./plans}"

# Start kanban dashboard
node $SKILL_DIR_PATH/scripts/server.cjs \
  --dir "$PLANS_DIR" \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --open \
  --foreground
```

**Critical:** When calling the Bash tool:

- Set `run_in_background: true` to run as CC background task
- Set `timeout: 300000` (5 minutes) to prevent premature termination
- Parse JSON output and report URL to user

Example Bash tool call:

```json
{
    "command": "node .claude/skills/plans-kanban/scripts/server.cjs --dir \"./plans\" --host 0.0.0.0 --open --foreground",
    "run_in_background": true,
    "timeout": 300000,
    "description": "Start kanban server in background"
}
```

After starting, parse the JSON output (e.g., `{"success":true,"url":"http://localhost:3500/kanban?dir=...","networkUrl":"http://192.168.1.x:3500/kanban?dir=..."}`) and report:

- Local URL for browser access
- Network URL for remote device access (if available)
- Inform user that server is now running as CC background task (visible in `/tasks`)

**CRITICAL:** MUST display the FULL URL including path and query string. NEVER truncate to just `host:port`. The full URL is required for direct access.

## Future Plans

The `/kanban` command will evolve into **VibeKanban-inspired** AI agent orchestration:

### Phase 1 (Current - MVP)

- ✅ Task board with progress tracking
- ✅ Visual representation of plans/tasks
- ✅ Click to view plan details

### Phase 2 (Worktree Integration)

- Create tasks → spawn git worktrees
- Assign agents to tasks
- Track agent progress per worktree

### Phase 3 (Full Orchestration)

- Parallel agent execution monitoring
- Code diff/review interface
- PR creation workflow
- Agent output streaming
- Conflict detection

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
