description: '[Code Quality] Review user stories for completeness, coverage, dependencies, and quality before implementation. AI self-review gate after /story.'

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — flag duplicated patterns that should be extracted to a base class, generic, or helper. Classes in the same group or suffix (ex *Entity, *Dto, \*Service, etc...) MUST inherit a common base (even if empty now — enables future shared logic and child overrides). Verify project has code linting/analyzer configured for the stack.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Auto-review user stories for completeness, acceptance criteria coverage, dependency ordering, and quality before implementation proceeds.

**Key distinction:** AI self-review (automatic), NOT user interview.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Workflow

1. **Locate stories** — Find story artifacts in `team-artifacts/stories/` or plan context
2. **Load source PBI** — Read the parent PBI to cross-reference acceptance criteria
3. **Evaluate checklist** — Score each check
4. **Classify** — PASS/WARN/FAIL
5. **Output verdict**

## Checklist

### Required (all must pass)

- [ ] **AC coverage** — Every acceptance criterion from PBI has at least one corresponding story
- [ ] **GIVEN/WHEN/THEN** — Each story has minimum 3 BDD scenarios (happy, edge, error)
- [ ] **INVEST criteria** — Stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- [ ] **Story points** — All stories have SP <=8 (>8 must be split)
- [ ] **Dependency table** — Story set includes dependency ordering table (must-after, can-parallel, independent)
- [ ] **No overlapping scope** — Stories don't duplicate functionality
- [ ] **Vertical slices** — Each story delivers end-to-end value (not horizontal layers)
- [ ] **Authorization scenarios** — Every story includes at least 1 authorization scenario (unauthorized access → rejection) per PBI roles table (ref: `.claude/skills/shared/cross-cutting-quality-concerns-protocol.md` §1)

### Recommended (>=50% should pass)

- [ ] **Edge cases** — Boundary values, empty states, max limits addressed
- [ ] **Error scenarios** — Failure paths explicitly covered in stories
- [ ] **API contract** — If API changes needed, story specifies contract
- [ ] **UI/UX considerations** — Frontend stories reference design specs or mockups
- [ ] **Seed data stories** — If PBI has seed data requirements, Sprint 0 seed data story exists (ref: `.claude/skills/shared/cross-cutting-quality-concerns-protocol.md` §2)
- [ ] **Data migration stories** — If PBI has schema changes, data migration story exists (ref: `.claude/skills/shared/cross-cutting-quality-concerns-protocol.md` §5)

## Output

```markdown
## Story Review Result

**Status:** PASS | WARN | FAIL
**Stories reviewed:** {count}
**Source PBI:** {pbi-path}

### AC Coverage Matrix

| Acceptance Criterion | Covered By Story | Status |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |

### Required ({X}/{Y})

- ✅/❌ Check description

### Recommended ({X}/{Y})

- ✅/⚠️ Check description

### Missing Stories

- {Any PBI AC not covered}

### Dependency Issues

- {Circular deps, missing ordering}

### Verdict

{PROCEED | REVISE_FIRST}
```

## Key Rules

- **FAIL blocks workflow** — If FAIL, do NOT proceed. List specific fixes.
- **Cross-reference PBI** — Every check against stories MUST trace back to PBI acceptance criteria.
- **No guessing** — Reference specific story content as evidence.
- **Flag missing stories** — If a PBI acceptance criterion has no covering story, that's a FAIL.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** after completing this skill, use `AskUserQuestion` to recommend:

- **"/plan (Recommended)"** — Create implementation plan from validated stories
- **"/story"** — Re-create stories if FAIL verdict
- **"/prioritize"** — Prioritize stories in backlog
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
