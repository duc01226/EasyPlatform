# Feature Investigation

READ-ONLY exploration skill for understanding existing features. No code changes.

## Mode Selection

| Mode            | Use When                                     | Workflow                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive** | User available, exploratory question         | Real-time collaboration, iterative tracing         |
| **Autonomous**  | Deep analysis, complex cross-service tracing | Structured 4-phase workflow with analysis artifact |

## Workflow

1. **Discovery** - Search codebase for all files related to the feature/question. Prioritize: Entities > Commands/Queries > EventHandlers > Controllers > Consumers > Components.
2. **Knowledge Graph** - Read and analyze each file. Document purpose, symbols, dependencies, data flow. Batch in groups of 10, update progress after each batch.
3. **Flow Mapping** - Trace entry points through processing pipeline to exit points. Map data transformations, persistence, side effects, cross-service boundaries.
4. **Analysis** - Extract business rules, validation logic, authorization, error handling. Document happy path and edge cases.
5. **Synthesis** - Write executive summary answering the original question. Include key files, patterns used, and text-based flow diagrams.
6. **Present** - Deliver findings using the structured output format. Offer deeper dives on subtopics.

## ⚠️ MUST READ Before Investigation

**IMPORTANT: You MUST read these files before starting. Do NOT skip.**

- **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/anti-hallucination-protocol.md` — Assumption validation, evidence chains, context anchoring
- **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/knowledge-graph-template.md` — Per-file analysis structure

**If preceded by `/scout`:** Use Scout's numbered file list as analysis targets. Skip redundant discovery. Prioritize HIGH PRIORITY files first.

## Investigation Techniques

### Discovery Search Patterns

#### File Discovery by Feature Name

```regex
.*EventHandler.*{FeatureName}|{FeatureName}.*EventHandler
.*BackgroundJob.*{FeatureName}|{FeatureName}.*BackgroundJob
.*Consumer.*{FeatureName}|{FeatureName}.*Consumer
.*Service.*{FeatureName}|{FeatureName}.*Service
.*Component.*{FeatureName}|{FeatureName}.*Component
```

#### Priority Order for Analysis

1. **Domain Entities** - Core business objects
2. **Commands/Queries** - CQRS entry points (`UseCaseCommands/`, `UseCaseQueries/`)
3. **Event Handlers** - Side effects (`UseCaseEvents/`, `*EventHandler.cs`)
4. **Controllers** - API endpoints (`Controllers/`, `*Controller.cs`)
5. **Consumers** - Cross-service (`*Consumer.cs`, `*BusMessage.cs`)
6. **Background Jobs** - Scheduled processing (`*BackgroundJob*.cs`, `*Job.cs`)
7. **Components/Stores** - Frontend (`*.component.ts`, `*.store.ts`)
8. **Services/Helpers** - Supporting logic (`*Service.cs`, `*Helper.cs`)

### Dependency Tracing

#### Backend (C#)

| Looking for                    | Search pattern                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who calls this method          | Grep method name across `*.cs`                                                  |
| Who injects this service       | Grep interface name in constructors                                             |
| What events this entity raises | Grep `PlatformCqrsEntityEvent<EntityName>`                                      |
| Cross-service consumers        | Grep `*BusMessage` type across all services                                     |
| Repository usage               | Grep `IRepository<EntityName>` or `IPlatformQueryableRootRepository<EntityName` |

#### Frontend (TypeScript)

| Looking for              | Search pattern                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who uses this component  | Grep selector `app-component-name` in `*.html`                    |
| Who imports this service | Grep service class name in `*.ts`                                 |
| Store effects chain      | Trace `effectSimple` -> API call -> `tapResponse` -> state update |
| Route entry              | Grep component name in `*routing*.ts`                             |

### Data Flow Mapping

Document flow as text diagram:

```text
[Entry Point] --> [Step 1: Validation] --> [Step 2: Processing] --> [Step 3: Persistence]
                                                  |
                                                  v
                                          [Side Effect: Event]
```

#### Flow Documentation Checklist

1. **Entry Points** - API endpoint, UI action, scheduled job, message bus
2. **Processing Pipeline** - Step-by-step through handlers
3. **Data Transformations** - How data changes at each step
4. **Persistence Points** - Where data is saved/loaded
5. **Exit Points** - Responses, events, side effects
6. **Cross-Service Flows** - Message bus boundaries

### Common Investigation Scenarios

#### "How does feature X work?"

1. Find entry points (API, UI, job)
2. Trace through command/query handlers
3. Document entity changes
4. Map side effects (events, notifications)

#### "Where is the logic for Y?"

1. Search keywords in commands, queries, entities
2. Check event handlers for side effect logic
3. Look in helper/service classes
4. Check frontend stores and components

#### "What happens when Z occurs?"

1. Identify trigger (user action, event, schedule)
2. Trace the handler chain
3. Document all side effects
4. Map error handling

#### "Why does A behave like B?"

1. Find the relevant code path
2. Identify decision points
3. Check configuration/feature flags
4. Document business rules

### Platform Pattern Recognition

#### Backend Patterns

- `PlatformCqrsCommand` / `PlatformCqrsQuery` - CQRS entry points
- `PlatformCqrsEntityEventApplicationHandler` - Side effects
- `PlatformApplicationMessageBusConsumer` - Cross-service consumers
- `IPlatformQueryableRootRepository` - Data access
- `PlatformValidationResult` - Validation logic
- `[PlatformAuthorize]` - Authorization

#### Frontend Patterns

- `AppBaseVmStoreComponent` - State management components
- `PlatformVmStore` - Store implementations
- `effectSimple` / `tapResponse` - Effect handling
- `observerLoadingErrorState` - Loading/error states
- API services extending `PlatformApiService`

## Guidelines

- **Evidence-based**: Every claim needs code evidence. Mark unverified claims as "inferred".
- **Question-focused**: Tie all findings back to the original question.
- **Read-only**: Never suggest changes unless explicitly asked.
- **Layered explanation**: Start simple, offer deeper detail on request.

## Related Skills

- `feature-implementation` - Implementing new features (code changes)
- `debugging` - Debugging and fixing issues
- `scout` - Quick codebase discovery (run before investigation)

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
