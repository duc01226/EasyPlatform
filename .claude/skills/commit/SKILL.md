## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Stage changes and create well-structured git commits following Conventional Commits format.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze Changes** — Run git status/diff to understand staged and unstaged changes
2. **Stage Changes** — Add relevant files (specific or all)
3. **Generate Message** — Detect type (feat/fix/refactor/etc.), extract scope from paths, write subject, and add a detailed body structured as **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works**
4. **Commit** — Create commit with HEREDOC (title + detailed summary + attribution footer)
5. **Verify** — Confirm with git status and git log

**Key Rules:**

- Write a detailed body — **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works** — so the next human reading `git log`/`git blame` understands the change without opening the diff. As detailed as the change needs (wrap ~72 chars); no title-only commits for non-trivial changes
- Stop after the commit; push only when the user explicitly requests it (or passes `--push` / says "commit and push" → stage + commit + push via `git-manager`)
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Never use `--amend` or `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- Include `Generated with [Claude Code]` attribution footer

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Git Commit Skill

Stage changes and create well-structured git commits following Conventional Commits format.

## IMPORTANT: Bypass git-commit-block Hook

Before running any `git add` or `git commit` commands, create the marker file to bypass the `git-commit-block` hook:

```bash
PROJ=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) && mkdir -p "$PROJ/tmp/claude-temp" && touch "$PROJ/tmp/claude-temp/.commit-skill-active"
```

After committing (success or failure), **always** clean up the marker:

```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tmp/claude-temp/.commit-skill-active"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

```bash
# Check current status (never use -uall flag)
git status

# See staged changes
git diff --cached

# See unstaged changes
git diff

# Check recent commit style
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add <file-path>
```

### Step 2.5: Docs-Update Triage

Before committing, check if staged files impact documentation:

1. Run `git diff --name-only --cached` to list staged files
2. Check if any staged file matches doc-impact patterns (resolve the concrete backend/frontend source paths from the project's structure reference / `docs/project-config.json`):
    - changes under the backend service source paths (per project config) → may impact `docs/specs/`
    - `.claude/skills/**` → may impact `.claude/docs/skills/`
    - `.claude/hooks/**` → may impact `.claude/docs/hooks/`
    - `.claude/workflows.json` → may impact `CLAUDE.md` workflow table
    - changes under the frontend app source paths (per project config) → may impact frontend pattern docs
3. If matches found: invoke `/docs-update` skill, then re-stage any doc changes with `git add`
4. If no matches: skip (log "No doc-impacting files staged")

### Step 3: Generate Commit Message

Analyze staged changes and generate message following **Conventional Commits**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<detailed summary of changes>
```

#### Type Detection

| Change Pattern          | Type       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| New file/feature        | `feat`     |
| Bug fix, error handling | `fix`      |
| Code restructure        | `refactor` |
| Documentation only      | `docs`     |
| Tests only              | `test`     |
| Dependencies, config    | `chore`    |
| Performance improvement | `perf`     |
| Formatting only         | `style`    |

#### Scope Rules

Extract from file paths:

- `{configured-source-root}/auth/` → `auth`
- `.claude/skills/` → `claude-skills`
- `libs/{shared-lib}/` → `{shared-lib}`
- Multiple unrelated areas → omit scope

#### Subject Rules

- Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Lowercase start
- No period at end
- Max 50 characters

#### Body Rules (MANDATORY) — write so a human understands fastest

> Body is the deliverable. Optimize for the next person running `git log` / `git blame` — they understand the change **without opening the diff**. As detailed as the change needs; no artificial brevity limit — wrap ~72 chars, stop once nothing new said. Title-only commit FORBIDDEN for any non-trivial change. — why: the diff shows WHAT; the body must carry WHY + HOW, which the diff cannot.

Structure body in three parts (omit a part only when genuinely empty):

1. **Purpose / kind** — Name **what kind of change and why it exists**: feature, bug fix (state symptom removed), enhancement, refactor (state behaviour-preserving), perf, security, chore. 1–2 sentences answering _"what problem does this solve?"_.
2. **What changed** — Concrete edits grouped by **behaviour** (not by file). Each bullet specific to behaviour/files touched — NEVER vague lines ("update code", "fix stuff", "minor fixes").
3. **How it works / why this way** — The part reviewers need. Explain **mechanism, key logic, invariants relied on, edge cases preserved**, and any non-obvious decision ("did X instead of obvious Y because Z"). Focus **non-obvious** — never narrate boilerplate. Ordering/timing/security-review invariant or subtle failure mode → call out explicitly.

> **Teach-the-reader mindset (from the `understand` skill):** cover BOTH high-level motivation (why it matters) AND low-level logic (business rules, edge cases). Surface what a reader would NOT guess from the diff — write the explanation you would want to receive.

**Detail dial — scale body to the change:**

| Change size                         | Body depth                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trivial (typo, rename, formatting)  | Purpose line + 1 bullet; skip "how it works"                                                                        |
| Normal (feature/fix, single area)   | Purpose + 2–5 "what" bullets + a short "how it works"                                                               |
| Complex (cross-cutting, subtle bug) | Purpose + grouped "what" + a full "how it works" that spells out the key invariant / edge case / why-this-over-that |

### Step 4: Commit

Use HEREDOC for proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject

- summarize key change 1 with intent
- summarize key change 2 with impact

Generated by AI
EOF
)"
```

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
git status
git log -1
```

## Examples

```
feat(order): add warehouse filter to list

- add warehouse query parameter in order list endpoint
- wire frontend filter control to request payload
- update tests for filtered and unfiltered list behavior

fix(validation): handle empty date range

- guard null/empty date inputs before parsing
- return validation message instead of throwing format exception
```

## Critical Rules

- **ALWAYS stage all unstaged changes** before committing — run `git add .` (or specific files) so nothing is left behind
- **Stop after the commit; push** to remote only when the user explicitly requests it
- **Review staged changes** before committing
- **Never commit** secrets, credentials, or .env files
- **Never use** `git commit --amend` unless explicitly requested AND the commit was created in this session AND not yet pushed
- **Never skip** hooks with `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- Commit message MUST include a Conventional Commit title AND a detailed body — **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works**. As detailed as the change needs (wrap ~72 chars); title-only commit FORBIDDEN for non-trivial changes
- Optimize body for the next human reading `git log` / `git blame` — surface the non-obvious (key logic, invariants, edge cases, why-this-over-that), not just a list of touched files
- Include attribution footer: `Generated by AI`

## Push & PR Operations

**Arg `--push` (a.k.a. "commit and push"):** stage all changes + create the commit + push to remote in one shot — spawn `git-manager` immediately after committing to push. This is the former standalone stage-commit-push entry point folded into `commit`; it adds no logic beyond the push delegation already described below.

This skill handles **commit** by default. Push-to-remote and pull request creation are delegated to `git-manager` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "git-manager"`).

`git-manager` handles:

- Conventional commit message validation enforcement
- `--no-verify` bypass prevention
- PR creation with structured summaries

Spawn `git-manager` after committing when user says "push", "create PR", or "open PR".

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY:** Push and PR operations spawn `git-manager` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "git-manager"`), NOT the main agent.
> **Rationale:** `git-manager` enforces conventional commits, prevents hook bypasses, and handles PR creation with structured summaries.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
