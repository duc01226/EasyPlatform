## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Deliver a user-confirmed, per-layer tech stack — each choice backed by 3+ researched options, weighted scoring, cited evidence, and a confidence % — by acting as a solution architect who derives technical requirements from business analysis, researches the current market, and produces a detailed comparison report, so the team commits to a stack fit for scale, budget, skills, and timeline, not familiarity.

**Summary:**

- Requirements come BEFORE research: load prior business/domain/PBI artifacts, map business signals to technical requirements, and gate on user confirmation (`AskUserQuestion`) before any WebSearch.
- Evaluate every stack layer (backend, frontend, database, messaging, infra, auth) independently — minimum 3 WebSearched options per layer, each with cited evidence (URL, benchmark, case study), never familiarity.
- Score with the weighted 8-criteria matrix (High=3x / Medium=2x / Low=1x), then rank each layer with a confidence %; capped <=200-line report goes to `{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md`.
- The end-of-skill user validation interview (5-8 questions) is mandatory and never skipped — only confirmed decisions get written to `phase-02-tech-stack.md` as `status: confirmed`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Load Business Context** — Read business evaluation, domain model, refined PBI artifacts
2. **Derive Technical Requirements** — Map business needs to technical constraints
3. **Research Per Layer** — WebSearch top 3 options for each stack responsibility
4. **Deep Compare** — Pros/cons matrix, benchmarks, community health, team fit
5. **Score & Rank** — Weighted scoring across 8 criteria
6. **Generate Report** — Structured comparison report with recommendation
7. **User Validation** — Present findings, ask 5-8 questions, confirm choices

**Key Rules:**

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research minimum 3 options per stack layer
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include confidence % with evidence for every recommendation
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run user validation interview at end (never skip)
- All claims must cite sources (URL, benchmark, case study)
- Recommend based on benchmarked evidence (URL, benchmark, case study); never on familiarity alone

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Step 1: Load Business Context

Read artifacts from prior workflow steps (search in `plans/` and `team-artifacts/`):

- Business evaluation report (viability, scale, constraints)
- Domain model / ERD (complexity, entity count, relationships)
- Refined PBI (acceptance criteria, scope)
- Discovery interview notes (team skills, budget, timeline)

Extract and summarize:

| Signal                 | Value        | Source              |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Expected users         | ...          | discovery interview |
| Domain complexity      | Low/Med/High | domain model        |
| Team skills            | ...          | discovery interview |
| Budget constraint      | ...          | business evaluation |
| Timeline               | ...          | business evaluation |
| Compliance needs       | ...          | business evaluation |
| Real-time needs        | Yes/No       | refined PBI         |
| Integration complexity | Low/Med/High | domain model        |

## Step 2: Derive Technical Requirements

Map business signals to technical requirements:

| Business Signal    | Technical Requirement                           | Priority |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| High user scale    | Horizontal scaling, connection pooling          | Must     |
| Complex domain     | Strong type system, ORM with migrations         | Must     |
| Real-time features | WebSocket/SSE support, event-driven arch        | Must     |
| Small team         | Low learning curve, good DX, batteries-included | Should   |
| Tight budget       | Open-source, low hosting cost                   | Should   |
| Compliance         | Audit trail, encryption, auth framework         | Must     |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate derived requirements with user via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding to research.

## Step 3: Research Per Stack Layer

For EACH layer, research top 3 options using WebSearch (minimum 5 queries total):

### Stack Layers to Evaluate

| Layer                  | Example Options                       | Research Focus                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Framework**  | Candidate backend runtimes/frameworks | Performance, type safety, ecosystem   |
| **Frontend Framework** | Candidate frontend frameworks         | DX, ecosystem, hiring, enterprise fit |
| **Database**           | Candidate database engines/stores     | Scale, query complexity, cost         |
| **Messaging/Events**   | Candidate messaging/event systems     | Throughput, reliability, complexity   |
| **Infrastructure**     | Docker+K8s, Serverless, PaaS          | Cost, ops overhead, scaling           |
| **Auth**               | Keycloak, Auth0, custom               | Cost, compliance, flexibility         |

### WebSearch Queries (minimum 5 per layer)

```
"{option_A} vs {option_B} {current_year} comparison"
"{option} enterprise production case studies"
"{option} community size github stars"
"{option} performance benchmarks {use_case}"
"{option} security track record vulnerabilities"
```

## Step 4: Deep Comparison Matrix

For EACH stack layer, produce a comparison table:

| Criteria             | Option A          | Option B | Option C | Weight |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Team Fit**         | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Scalability**      | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Time-to-Market**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Ecosystem/Libs**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Hiring Market**    | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Cost (hosting)**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Learning Curve**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Community Health** | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Low    |

Scoring: 1-5 scale. Weight: High=3x, Medium=2x, Low=1x.

### Per-Option Detail Block

For each option, document:

```markdown
### {Layer}: {Option Name}

**Pros:**

- {Pro 1} — {evidence/source}
- {Pro 2} — {evidence/source}
- {Pro 3} — {evidence/source}

**Cons:**

- {Con 1} — {evidence/source}
- {Con 2} — {evidence/source}

**Best suited when:** {conditions}
**Not suitable when:** {conditions}
**Production examples:** {2-3 real companies using this}
```

## Step 5: Weighted Score & Ranking

Calculate weighted total per option per layer. Present ranking:

```markdown
### {Layer} Ranking

1. **{Option A}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%
2. **{Option B}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%
3. **{Option C}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%

**Recommendation:** {Option A}
**Why:** {2-3 sentence rationale linking to team skills, scale, and constraints}
```

## Step 6: Generate Report

Write report to `{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md` with:

1. Executive summary (recommended full stack in 5 lines)
2. Technical requirements table (from Step 2)
3. Per-layer comparison matrices (from Step 4)
4. Per-layer rankings with recommendations (from Step 5)
5. Combined recommended stack diagram
6. Risk assessment for recommended stack
7. Alternative stack (second-best combo) for comparison
8. Unresolved questions

Report must be **<=200 lines**. Use tables over prose.

## Step 7: User Validation Interview

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** present findings and ask 5-8 questions via `AskUserQuestion`:

### Required Questions

1. **Per-layer recommendation confirmation** — "For {layer}, I recommend {option}. Agree?"
    - Options: Agree (Recommended) | Prefer {option B} | Need more research
2. **Risk tolerance** — "The recommended stack has {risk}. Acceptable?"
3. **Team readiness** — "Team needs to learn {X}. Training plan needed?"
4. **Budget alignment** — "Estimated infra cost: ${X}/month. Within budget?"
5. **Timeline fit** — "This stack enables MVP in {X} months. Acceptable?"

### Optional Deep-Dive Questions (pick 2-3 based on context)

- "Should we consider {emerging tech} for {layer}?"
- "Any compliance requirements I haven't captured?"
- "Preference for managed services vs self-hosted?"
- "Monorepo or polyrepo for this team size?"

After user confirms, update report with final decisions and mark as `status: confirmed`.

## Output

```
{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md    # Full comparison report
{plan-dir}/phase-02-tech-stack.md               # Final confirmed tech stack decisions
```

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate EVERY recommendation with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include confidence % and evidence citations for all claims.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/architecture-design (Recommended)"** — Design solution architecture with chosen tech stack
- **"/plan"** — If architecture already decided
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

### Council escalation (always-offer, second prompt)

After the existing `## Next Steps` prompt above resolves, present a **second**, independent `AskUserQuestion` call:

- **"Skip council — proceed with chosen stack (Recommended)"** — Continue with the selected tech stack as-is.
- **"Escalate to /llm-council"** — Run 11 sub-agent council. Best applied when 2+ stacks score within 15% on the comparison matrix or you have unfamiliar/strategic dependencies. Cheaper alternatives: `/why-review`, `/plan-validate`.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** deliver user-confirmed, per-layer tech stack — each choice backed by 3+ researched options, weighted 8-criteria scoring, cited evidence, confidence % — so team commits to a stack fit for scale, budget, skills, timeline, NOT familiarity.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof, confidence >80% to act, NEVER guess as fact.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research minimum 3 WebSearched options per stack layer (backend, frontend, database, messaging, infra, auth); every recommendation carries confidence % + cited evidence (URL, benchmark, case study) — NEVER recommend on familiarity alone — why: familiarity bias commits the team to the wrong stack that surfaces only at scale.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** gate on user via `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY decision point — confirm derived requirements before research (Step 2), confirm each layer recommendation in the end interview (Step 7) — NEVER auto-decide — why: the team owns the stack, not the AI.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting; mark one `in_progress`, `completed` immediately after evidence; add a final review todo.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** requirements come BEFORE research — load prior business/domain/PBI artifacts (Step 1), map business signals to technical requirements (Step 2), user-confirm them, THEN WebSearch (Step 3) — NEVER research before requirements are derived and confirmed — why: researching first picks tech then back-fits the problem, the reverse of architecture.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** score every layer with the weighted 8-criteria matrix (High=3x / Medium=2x / Low=1x), rank with confidence %, cap the `{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md` report at <=200 lines using tables over prose — why: an unscored or unbounded report hides the trade-off the decision turns on.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** only user-confirmed decisions get written to `phase-02-tech-stack.md` as `status: confirmed` — the end interview (5-8 `AskUserQuestion` questions) is mandatory and never skipped even when the choice seems "obvious" — why: an unconfirmed stack is a guess the team will pay for.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line`/URL proof or traced evidence + confidence % (>80% act, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend) — NEVER present a guess as fact — why: a stack chosen on speculation fails silently until production.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evaluate fit before copying a reference stack from another project — verify the new context shares the same scale, budget, team skills, compliance, and timeline constraints — why: the closest example rarely matches preconditions, and a mismatched copy compiles but fails the real requirements.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Stack is obvious — skip the research"           | 3+ WebSearched options per layer with cited evidence anyway — familiarity is not evidence. |
| "I already know this is the best framework"      | Show the weighted 8-criteria score + confidence %. No matrix = no recommendation.          |
| "Skip the user interview, the choice is clear"   | The end interview is MANDATORY — only `status: confirmed` decisions get written.           |
| "Just research the stack, requirements are fine" | Derive + user-confirm technical requirements FIRST (Steps 1-2), then research.             |
| "One source is enough for this layer"            | Cite URL + benchmark + case study; a single anecdote is not benchmarked evidence.          |

> **External Memory:** For research/analysis work, write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, recommendation requires `file:line`/URL proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).
