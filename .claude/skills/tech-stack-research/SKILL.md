> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY decision point — never assume user preferences.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research top 3 options per stack layer, compare with evidence, present report with recommendation + confidence %.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Research, analyze, and compare tech stack options for each layer of the system. Act as a solution architect — derive technical requirements from business analysis, research current market, produce detailed comparison report, and present options to user for decision.

**Workflow:**

1. **Load Business Context** — Read business evaluation, domain model, refined PBI artifacts
2. **Derive Technical Requirements** — Map business needs to technical constraints
3. **Research Per Layer** — WebSearch top 3 options for each stack responsibility
4. **Deep Compare** — Pros/cons matrix, benchmarks, community health, team fit
5. **Score & Rank** — Weighted scoring across 8 criteria
6. **Generate Report** — Structured comparison report with recommendation
7. **User Validation** — Present findings, ask 5-8 questions, confirm choices

**Key Rules:**

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research minimum 3 options per stack layer
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include confidence % with evidence for every recommendation
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run user validation interview at end (never skip)
- All claims must cite sources (URL, benchmark, case study)
- Never recommend based on familiarity alone — evidence required

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Step 1: Load Business Context

Read artifacts from prior workflow steps (search in `plans/` and `team-artifacts/`):

- Business evaluation report (viability, scale, constraints)
- Domain model / ERD (complexity, entity count, relationships)
- Refined PBI (acceptance criteria, scope)
- Discovery interview notes (team skills, budget, timeline)

Extract and summarize:

| Signal                 | Value        | Source              |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Expected users         | ...          | discovery interview |
| Domain complexity      | Low/Med/High | domain model        |
| Team skills            | ...          | discovery interview |
| Budget constraint      | ...          | business evaluation |
| Timeline               | ...          | business evaluation |
| Compliance needs       | ...          | business evaluation |
| Real-time needs        | Yes/No       | refined PBI         |
| Integration complexity | Low/Med/High | domain model        |

## Step 2: Derive Technical Requirements

Map business signals to technical requirements:

| Business Signal    | Technical Requirement                           | Priority |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| High user scale    | Horizontal scaling, connection pooling          | Must     |
| Complex domain     | Strong type system, ORM with migrations         | Must     |
| Real-time features | WebSocket/SSE support, event-driven arch        | Must     |
| Small team         | Low learning curve, good DX, batteries-included | Should   |
| Tight budget       | Open-source, low hosting cost                   | Should   |
| Compliance         | Audit trail, encryption, auth framework         | Must     |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate derived requirements with user via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding to research.

## Step 3: Research Per Stack Layer

For EACH layer, research top 3 options using WebSearch (minimum 5 queries total):

### Stack Layers to Evaluate

| Layer                  | Example Options                 | Research Focus                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Framework**  | .NET, Node.js, Python, Go, Java | Performance, type safety, ecosystem   |
| **Frontend Framework** | Angular, React, Vue, Svelte     | DX, ecosystem, hiring, enterprise fit |
| **Database**           | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server | Scale, query complexity, cost         |
| **Messaging/Events**   | RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams  | Throughput, reliability, complexity   |
| **Infrastructure**     | Docker+K8s, Serverless, PaaS    | Cost, ops overhead, scaling           |
| **Auth**               | Keycloak, Auth0, custom         | Cost, compliance, flexibility         |

### WebSearch Queries (minimum 5 per layer)

```
"{option_A} vs {option_B} {current_year} comparison"
"{option} enterprise production case studies"
"{option} community size github stars"
"{option} performance benchmarks {use_case}"
"{option} security track record vulnerabilities"
```

## Step 4: Deep Comparison Matrix

For EACH stack layer, produce a comparison table:

| Criteria             | Option A          | Option B | Option C | Weight |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Team Fit**         | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Scalability**      | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Time-to-Market**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | High   |
| **Ecosystem/Libs**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Hiring Market**    | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Cost (hosting)**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Learning Curve**   | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Medium |
| **Community Health** | score + rationale | ...      | ...      | Low    |

Scoring: 1-5 scale. Weight: High=3x, Medium=2x, Low=1x.

### Per-Option Detail Block

For each option, document:

```markdown
### {Layer}: {Option Name}

**Pros:**

- {Pro 1} — {evidence/source}
- {Pro 2} — {evidence/source}
- {Pro 3} — {evidence/source}

**Cons:**

- {Con 1} — {evidence/source}
- {Con 2} — {evidence/source}

**Best suited when:** {conditions}
**Not suitable when:** {conditions}
**Production examples:** {2-3 real companies using this}
```

## Step 5: Weighted Score & Ranking

Calculate weighted total per option per layer. Present ranking:

```markdown
### {Layer} Ranking

1. **{Option A}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%
2. **{Option B}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%
3. **{Option C}** — Score: {X}/100 — Confidence: {Y}%

**Recommendation:** {Option A}
**Why:** {2-3 sentence rationale linking to team skills, scale, and constraints}
```

## Step 6: Generate Report

Write report to `{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md` with:

1. Executive summary (recommended full stack in 5 lines)
2. Technical requirements table (from Step 2)
3. Per-layer comparison matrices (from Step 4)
4. Per-layer rankings with recommendations (from Step 5)
5. Combined recommended stack diagram
6. Risk assessment for recommended stack
7. Alternative stack (second-best combo) for comparison
8. Unresolved questions

Report must be **<=200 lines**. Use tables over prose.

## Step 7: User Validation Interview

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** present findings and ask 5-8 questions via `AskUserQuestion`:

### Required Questions

1. **Per-layer recommendation confirmation** — "For {layer}, I recommend {option}. Agree?"
    - Options: Agree (Recommended) | Prefer {option B} | Need more research
2. **Risk tolerance** — "The recommended stack has {risk}. Acceptable?"
3. **Team readiness** — "Team needs to learn {X}. Training plan needed?"
4. **Budget alignment** — "Estimated infra cost: ${X}/month. Within budget?"
5. **Timeline fit** — "This stack enables MVP in {X} months. Acceptable?"

### Optional Deep-Dive Questions (pick 2-3 based on context)

- "Should we consider {emerging tech} for {layer}?"
- "Any compliance requirements I haven't captured?"
- "Preference for managed services vs self-hosted?"
- "Monorepo or polyrepo for this team size?"

After user confirms, update report with final decisions and mark as `status: confirmed`.

## Output

```
{plan-dir}/research/tech-stack-comparison.md    # Full comparison report
{plan-dir}/phase-02-tech-stack.md               # Final confirmed tech stack decisions
```

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate EVERY recommendation with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include confidence % and evidence citations for all claims.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/architecture-design (Recommended)"** — Design solution architecture with chosen tech stack
- **"/plan"** — If architecture already decided
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides
