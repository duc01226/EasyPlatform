> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

- `docs/specs/` — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs to include test strategy in plan)

> **Skill Variant:** Variant of `/plan` — creates two alternative implementation approaches for comparison.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Research and create an implementation plan with 2 distinct approaches for the user to compare and choose.

**Workflow:**

1. **Research** — Deep investigation of the problem space
2. **Approach A** — Design first implementation approach with trade-offs
3. **Approach B** — Design alternative approach with trade-offs
4. **Compare** — Present side-by-side comparison for user decision

**Key Rules:**

- PLANNING-ONLY: do not implement, only create comparison plan
- Both approaches must be genuinely viable, not strawman vs real
- Always offer `/plan-review` after plan creation

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Activate `planning` skill.

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the `EnterPlanMode` tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS run `/plan-review` to validate the plan.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

## Your mission

Use the `planner` subagent to create 2 detailed implementation plans for this following task:
<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Workflow

1. First: Create a directory using naming pattern from `## Naming` section in injected context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Use multiple `researcher` agents in parallel to research for this task, each agent research for a different aspect of the task and perform max 5 researches (max 5 tool calls).
4. Use `scout` agent to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
5. Main agent gathers all research and scout report filepaths, and pass them to `planner` subagent with the detailed instructions prompt to create an implementation plan of this task.
   **Output:** Provide at least 2 implementation approaches with clear trade-offs, and explain the pros and cons of each approach, and provide a recommended approach.
6. Main agent receives the implementation plan from `planner` subagent, and ask user to review the plan

## Plan File Specification

- Every `plan.md` MUST ATTENTION start with YAML frontmatter:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: '{Brief title}'
    description: '{One sentence for card preview}'
    status: pending
    priority: P2
    story_points: { 1-21 modified fibonacci }
    complexity: '{ Low | Medium | High | Critical }'
    man_days_traditional: '{ e.g., 4d (2.5d code + 1.5d test) }'
    man_days_ai: '{ e.g., 2d (1.3d code + 0.7d test) }'
    effort: { sum of phases, e.g., 4h }
    branch: { current git branch }
    tags: [relevant, tags]
    created: { YYYY-MM-DD }
    ---
    ```

## **IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
- **MANDATORY FINAL TASKS:** After creating all planning todo tasks, ALWAYS add these three final tasks:
    1. **Task: "Write test specifications for each phase"** — Add `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} IDs to every phase file. Use `/tdd-spec` if feature docs exist. Use `Evidence: TBD` for TDD-first mode.
    2. **Task: "Run /plan-validate"** — Trigger `/plan-validate` skill to interview the user with critical questions and validate plan assumptions
    3. **Task: "Run /plan-review"** — Trigger `/plan-review` skill to auto-review plan for validity, correctness, and best practices

## Important Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Post-Plan Validation

After plan creation, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask: "Want me to run `/plan-review` to validate, or proceed to implementation?" with options:

- "Run /plan-review (Recommended)" — Execute `/plan-review` to validate the plan
- "Proceed to implementation" — Skip validation and start implementing

## REMINDER — Planning-Only Command

> **DO NOT** use `EnterPlanMode` tool.
> **DO NOT** start implementing.
> **ALWAYS** validate with `/plan-review` after plan creation.
> **ASK** user to confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
> **ASK** user decision questions with your recommendations when multiple approaches exist.

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (plan created). This ensures review, validation, implementation, and testing steps aren't skipped.
- **"/plan-review"** — Auto-review plan for validity and best practices
- **"/plan-validate"** — Interview user to confirm plan decisions
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include Test Specifications section and story_points in plan frontmatter
    <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
      <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai` in plan/PBI frontmatter. Use SP table: SP 1=0.5d/0.25d, SP 2=1d/0.35d, SP 3=2d/0.65d, SP 5=4d/1.0d, SP 8=6d/1.5d · SP 13=10d/2.0d. SP 13 SHOULD split, SP 21 MUST split.
