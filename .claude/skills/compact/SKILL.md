## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Compress conversation context to optimize token usage while preserving critical information.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze** — Identify essential vs. expendable context
2. **Compress** — Remove redundant tool outputs / repeated searches / verbose logs; summarize findings
3. **Verify** — Ensure critical decisions, files modified, and current task state are preserved

**Key Rules:**

- Canonical compress protocol + the full 4-strategy framework (write/select/compress/isolate) + token thresholds live in `context-optimization` — this skill is the command surface only
- Preserve: decisions made, files modified, current task state, error/stack traces, todos
- Use `/compact` at natural breakpoints (after commits, PR), not mid-task

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Compact Context

Proactively compress the current conversation context to optimize token usage. This is the user-invocable alias for `context-optimization`'s Compress strategy.

## When to Use

- Before starting a new task in a long session
- When working on multiple unrelated features
- At natural workflow checkpoints (after commits, PR creation)
- When the context indicator shows high usage (≥100K tokens → required; ≥150K → critical)

## Instructions

1. **Run the Pre-Compaction Preservation Checklist** — canonical in `.claude/skills/context-optimization/SKILL.md` (Strategy #3 → "Pre-Compaction Preservation Checklist"): branch + uncommitted-changes status, active file paths, error messages / stack traces, key decisions + rationale, pending todos.
2. **Compress** — summarize completed work + key decisions; clear redundant history (old exploration, superseded plans); keep active file paths, current task, blockers.
3. **Restate objective** — after compacting, briefly restate the current objective and confirm critical file paths are still accessible.

For the full context-management framework (Write / Select / Compress / Isolate strategies, context-anchor protocol, memory commands, token-efficient patterns), see `context-optimization`.

## Related Commands

- `context-optimization` — full 4-strategy context-management framework (canonical owner)
- `/checkpoint` — save analysis context to an external file before compaction
- `/recover` — restore workflow context from the latest checkpoint

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION sequential thinking, traced `file:line` proof, confidence >80% to act.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
