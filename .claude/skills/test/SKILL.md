## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Deliver an accurate, read-only pass/fail verdict — by running tests locally via the `tester` subagent and analyzing the summary report — with exact counts, failing-test names, report path, and Goal Contract evidence, so the user knows the true test state without any fix applied.

**Summary:**

- Always run tests through the `tester` subagent — never invoke test commands directly — then analyze its summary report.
- This skill is strictly READ-ONLY: report pass/fail counts, failing-test names, and the report path; stop at reporting and NEVER start implementing fixes (that is `/fix`'s job).
- After the run, resolve the active Goal Contract and append verification evidence (command, exact counts, report path) to the goal file's Iteration Log, updating the Goal Satisfaction matrix; record "No active goal" inline when none exists. Never copy sensitive fixture data into the goal file.

**Workflow:**

1. **Delegate** — Launch `tester` subagent with test scope from arguments
2. **Analyze** — Review test results, identify failures and patterns
3. **Report** — Summarize pass/fail counts, highlight failing tests

**Key Rules:**

- READ-ONLY: do not implement fixes, only report results
- Activate relevant skills from catalog during process
- Always use `tester` subagent, not direct test commands

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Use the `tester` subagent to run tests locally and analyze the summary report.

**IMPORTANT**: Stop at reporting results — do not start implementing.
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

**Goal Contract evidence (after test run):** Resolve the active Goal Contract per the goal-contract-satisfaction-loop protocol (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`). When one exists, append the verification evidence to the goal file's Iteration Log — test command, exact pass/fail counts, report path — mapped to the saved success criteria the run verifies, and update the Goal Satisfaction matrix rows for those criteria (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED). Record `No active goal — evidence reported inline only.` when none exists. Never copy raw sensitive fixture data into the goal file.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, a refactor, a test, or an abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated design that
  isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `testing` workflow** (Recommended) — test
> 2. **Execute `/test` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/docs-update (Recommended)"** — Update documentation after tests pass
- **"/fix"** — If tests revealed failures that need fixing
- **"/watzup"** — Wrap up session and review all changes
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** deliver an accurate, read-only pass/fail verdict — run tests via the `tester` subagent, analyze its summary report — with exact counts, failing-test names, report path, and Goal Contract evidence, so the user knows the true test state without any fix applied.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Critical Thinking:** ALWAYS apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof, confidence >80%.
- **Evidence:** ALWAYS cite `file:line` per claim; NEVER speculate without proof.
- **Source/Test Drift:** when source changes, decide from evidence whether test or source is wrong; NEVER assume.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ-ONLY — run tests, report pass/fail counts + failing-test names + report path; NEVER implement fixes here, stop at reporting — why: fixing is `/fix`'s job; mixing the two hides the true test state.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ALWAYS run tests through the `tester` subagent; NEVER invoke test commands directly — why: the subagent isolates the run and produces the canonical summary report this skill analyzes.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** resolve the active Goal Contract after the run; append verification evidence (test command, exact pass/fail counts, report path) to the goal file's Iteration Log and update the Goal Satisfaction matrix; record `No active goal — evidence reported inline only.` when none exists; NEVER copy raw sensitive fixture data into the goal file — why: the goal file is the durable PASS/FAIL ledger, not a secrets store.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim about a failure (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first); NEVER speculate which test failed or why — read the report — why: a guessed failure verdict sends the user to fix the wrong thing.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** before asserting a test/source relationship, grep 3+ similar tests and match the local pattern; apply the source/test drift check — decide from evidence whether a failing test guards intended behavior or the source is the bug — why: a mismatched assumption mislabels a real bug as a flaky test.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting; mark one `in_progress`, complete immediately after evidence; add a final review todo to verify work quality.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate route/decisions with the user via `AskUserQuestion` — NEVER auto-decide a workflow vs standalone run.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ `CLAUDE.md` before starting.

| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| "I can run the test command directly"     | NEVER — always delegate to the `tester` subagent; direct runs bypass the canonical report.      |
| "Failure looks trivial, I'll just fix it" | Stop at reporting. Fixing is `/fix`'s job; this skill is strictly READ-ONLY.                    |
| "No goal file, skip the evidence step"    | Record `No active goal — evidence reported inline only.` Never silently skip the Goal Contract. |
| "I know which test failed"                | Show `file:line` + the report path. No proof = no claim.                                        |

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
