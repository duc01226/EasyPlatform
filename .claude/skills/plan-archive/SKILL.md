> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:

> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Write journal entries and archive completed or obsolete plans from the plans/ directory.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** -- Find plans to archive (specific or all completed)
2. **Journal** -- Write summary journal entry for archived plans
3. **Archive** -- Move plans to archive location or mark as completed

**Key Rules:**

- Preserve plan content during archival, never delete
- Write journal entry documenting what was archived and why
- Clean up plans/ directory for better organization

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Your mission

Read and analyze the plans, then write journal entries and archive specific plans or all plans in the `plans` directory.

## Plan Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` provided → Use that path
2. Else read all plans in the `plans` directory

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read the plan directory:

- `plan.md` - Overview and phases list
- `phase-*.md` - 20 first lines of each phase file to understand the progress and status

### Step 2: Summarize the plans and document them with `/journal` slash command

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to document journal entries or not.
Skip this step if user selects "No".
If user selects "Yes":

- Analyze the information in previous steps.
- Use Task tool with `subagent_type="journal-writer"` in parallel to document all plans.
- Journal entries should be concise and focused on the most important events, key changes, impacts, and decisions.
- Keep journal entries in the `./docs/journals/` directory.

### Step 3: Ask user to confirm the action before archiving these plans

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to proceed with archiving these plans, select specific plans to archive or all completed plans only.
Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to delete permanently or move to the `./plans/archive` directory.

### Step 4: Archive the plans

Start archiving the plans based on the user's choice:

- Move the plans to the `./plans/archive` directory.
- Delete the plans permanently: `rm -rf ./plans/<plan-1> ./plans/<plan-2> ...`

### Step 5: Ask if user wants to commit the changes

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to commit the changes with these options:

- Stage and commit the changes (Use `/commit` slash command)
- Commit and push the changes (Use `/git-cp` slash command)
- Nah, I'll do it later

## Output

After archiving the plans, provide summary:

- Number of plans archived
- Number of plans deleted permanently
- Table of plans that are archived or deleted (title, status, created date, LOC)
- Table of journal entries that are created (title, status, created date, LOC)

## Important Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Only ask questions about genuine decision points - don't manufacture artificial choices.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing outputs.
**IMPORTANT:** In the last summary report, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include Test Specifications section and story_points in plan frontmatter
      <!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.
      <!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.
