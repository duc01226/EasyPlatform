## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Execute an implementation plan phase end-to-end without running tests (code + review + commit).

**Workflow:**

1. **Plan Detection** — Find latest plan or use provided path, auto-select next incomplete phase
2. **Analysis** — Extract tasks from phase file, initialize todo tracking
3. **Implementation** — Code changes step-by-step, run type checks
4. **Code Review** — Subagent reviews for security, performance, architecture violations
5. **User Approval** — Blocking gate requiring explicit approval
6. **Finalize** — Update plan status, docs, auto-commit

**Key Rules:**

- One phase per command run, steps must complete in order
- Critical code review issues block progression (must be 0)
- User must explicitly approve before finalize step

**MUST ATTENTION READ** `CLAUDE.md` then **THINK HARDER** to start working on the following plan follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

<plan>$ARGUMENTS</plan>

---

## Role Responsibilities

- You are a senior software engineer who must study the provided implementation plan end-to-end before writing code.
- Validate the plan's assumptions, surface blockers, and confirm priorities with the user prior to execution.
- Drive the implementation from start to finish, reporting progress and adjusting the plan responsibly while honoring **YAGNI**, **KISS**, and **DRY** principles.

**IMPORTANT:** Remind these rules with subagents communication:

- Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
- Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.

---

## Step 0: Plan Detection & Phase Selection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:**

1. Find latest `plan.md` in `./plans` | `find ./plans -name "plan.md" -type f -exec stat -f "%m %N" {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-`
2. Parse plan for phases and status, auto-select next incomplete (prefer IN_PROGRESS or earliest Planned)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:** Use that plan and detect which phase to work on (auto-detect or use argument like "phase-2").

**Output:** `✓ Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]`

**Subagent Pattern (use throughout):**

```
Task(subagent_type="[type]", prompt="[task description]", description="[brief]")
```

---

## Workflow Sequence

**Rules:** Follow steps 1-6 in order. Each step requires output marker starting with "✓ Step N:". Mark each complete in TaskCreate before proceeding. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Analysis & Task Extraction

Read plan file completely. Map dependencies between tasks. List ambiguities or blockers. Identify required skills/tools and activate from catalog. Parse phase file and extract actionable tasks. If the plan references analysis files in `.ai/workspace/analysis/`, re-read them before implementation.

**TaskCreate Initialization & Task Extraction:**

- Initialize TaskCreate with `Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]` and all command steps (Step 1 through Step 6)
- Read phase file (e.g., phase-01-preparation.md)
- Look for tasks/steps/phases/sections/numbered/bulleted lists
- MUST ATTENTION convert to TaskCreate tasks:
    - Phase Implementation tasks → Step 2.X (Step 2.1, Step 2.2, etc.)
    - Phase Code Review tasks → Step 3.X (Step 3.1, Step 3.2, etc.)
- Ensure each task has UNIQUE name (increment X for each task)
- Add tasks to TaskCreate after their corresponding command step

**Output:** `✓ Step 1: Found [N] tasks across [M] phases - Ambiguities: [list or "none"]`

Mark Step 1 complete in TaskCreate, mark Step 2 in_progress.

---

## Step 2: Implementation

Implement selected plan phase step-by-step following extracted tasks (Step 2.1, Step 2.2, etc.). Mark tasks complete as done. For UI work, call `ui-ux-designer` subagent: "Implement [feature] UI per./docs/design-guidelines.md". Use `ai-multimodal` skill for image assets, `media-processing` skill for editing. Run type checking and compile to verify no syntax errors.

**Output:** `✓ Step 2: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete, compilation passed`

Mark Step 2 complete in TaskCreate, mark Step 3 in_progress.

---

## Step 3: Code Review

Call `code-reviewer` subagent: "Review changes for plan phase [phase-name]. Check security, performance, architecture, YAGNI/KISS/DRY". If critical issues found: STOP, fix all, re-run `tester` to verify, re-run `code-reviewer`. Repeat until no critical issues.

**Critical issues:** Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, OWASP), performance bottlenecks, architectural violations, principle violations.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3: Code reviewed - [0] critical issues`

**Validation:** If critical issues > 0, keep Step 3 open and resolve them before advancing — Step 3 stays INCOMPLETE until the count is 0.

Mark Step 3 complete in TaskCreate, mark Step 4 in_progress.

---

## Step 4: User Approval ⏸ BLOCKING GATE

Present summary (3-5 bullets): what implemented, code review outcome.

**Ask user explicitly:** "Phase implementation complete. Code reviewed. Approve changes?"

**Stop and wait** - do not output Step 5 content until user responds.

**Output (while waiting):** `⏸ Step 4: WAITING for user approval`

**Output (after approval):** `✓ Step 4: User approved - Ready to complete`

Mark Step 4 complete in TaskCreate, mark Step 5 in_progress.

---

## Step 5: Finalize

**Prerequisites:** User approved in Step 4 (verified above).

1. **STATUS UPDATE - BOTH MANDATORY - PARALLEL EXECUTION:**

- **Call** `project-manager` sub-agent: "Update plan status in [plan-path]. Mark plan phase [phase-name] as DONE with timestamp. Update roadmap."
- **Call** `docs-manager` sub-agent: "Update docs for plan phase [phase-name]. Changed files: [list]."

2. **ONBOARDING CHECK:** Detect onboarding requirements (API keys, env vars, config) + generate summary report with next steps.

3. **AUTO-COMMIT (after steps 1 and 2 completes):**

- Run only if: Steps 1 and 2 successful + User approved + Tests passed
- Auto-stage, commit with message [phase - plan] and push

**Validation:** Steps 1 and 2 must complete successfully. Step 3 (auto-commit) runs only if conditions met.

Mark Step 5 complete in TaskCreate.

**Phase workflow finished. Ready for next plan phase.**

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, a refactor, a test, or an abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated design that
  isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Critical Enforcement Rules

**Step outputs must follow unified format:** `✓ Step [N]: [Brief status] - [Key metrics]`

**Examples:**

- Step 0: `✓ Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]`
- Step 1: `✓ Step 1: Found [N] tasks across [M] phases - Ambiguities: [list]`
- Step 2: `✓ Step 2: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete`
- Step 3: `✓ Step 3: Code reviewed - [0] critical issues`
- Step 4: `✓ Step 4: User approved - Ready to complete`
- Step 5: `✓ Step 5: Finalize - Status updated - Git committed`

**If any "✓ Step N:" output missing, that step is INCOMPLETE.**

**TaskCreate tracking required:** Initialize at Step 0, mark each step complete before next.

**Mandatory subagent calls:**

- Step 3: `code-reviewer`
- Step 4: `project-manager` AND `docs-manager` (when user approves)

**Blocking gates:**

- Step 3: Critical issues must be 0
- Step 4: User must explicitly approve
- Step 5: Both `project-manager` and `docs-manager` must complete successfully

**REMEMBER:**

- Execute every step in order; proceed only when validation passes and the user has explicitly approved.
- One plan phase per command run. Command focuses on single plan phase only.
- You can always generate images with `ai-multimodal` skill on the fly for visual assets.
- You always read and analyze the generated assets with `ai-multimodal` skill to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use `media-processing` skill or similar tools as needed.

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (code implemented, no tests). This ensures review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/code-simplifier"** — Simplify implementation
- **"/workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
