# Connect API

Detect frontend HTTP calls and match them to backend route definitions, creating `API_ENDPOINT` edges in the knowledge graph.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Detect frontend-to-backend API connections using the knowledge graph. Matches HTTP calls (Angular, React, Vue, fetch, axios) with backend routes (.NET, Spring, Express, FastAPI) via project-config.json configuration.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## How It Works

The connector scans frontend files for HTTP calls and backend files for route definitions, normalizes URL paths, and matches them using a multi-strategy algorithm:

1. **Exact match** — normalized paths identical
2. **Prefix-augmented** — prepends `routePrefix` to frontend path
3. **Suffix match** — strips `routePrefix` from backend, matches remainder
4. **Deep strip** — strips leading `{param}` segments from backend (handles class-level `{companyId}` routes)
5. **Controller resolution** — resolves .NET `[controller]` placeholder to actual class name

## Zero-Config Auto-Detection

**No configuration needed.** The connector auto-detects frameworks by scanning for marker files:

| Frontend | Markers                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular  | `angular.json`, `nx.json`, `@angular/core` in package.json |
| React    | `react` in package.json                                    |
| Vue      | `vue.config.js`, `vue` in package.json                     |
| Next.js  | `next.config.js`, `next` in package.json                   |
| Svelte   | `svelte.config.js`, `svelte` in package.json               |

| Backend | Markers                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| .NET    | `*.csproj` with `Microsoft.AspNetCore`      |
| Spring  | `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` with `spring-boot` |
| Express | `express` in package.json                   |
| NestJS  | `@nestjs/core` in package.json              |
| FastAPI | `fastapi` in requirements.txt               |
| Django  | `manage.py` with django                     |
| Rails   | `Gemfile` with `rails`                      |
| Go      | `go.mod` (Gin/Echo patterns)                |

## Auto-Run Behavior

The connector runs **automatically** in these situations:

| When                                    | Behavior                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| After `build` / `update` / `sync`       | Always runs via `_auto_connect()`                            |
| First `trace` / `query` / `connections` | Runs once via `_ensure_connectors_ran()` if never run before |

**You almost never need to run this manually.** The graph CLI handles it automatically.

## Custom Config (Optional)

For projects with custom HTTP patterns (e.g., base class API service), add to `docs/project-config.json`:

```json
{
    "graphConnectors": {
        "apiEndpoints": {
            "enabled": true,
            "frontend": {
                "framework": "angular",
                "paths": ["src/app/"],
                "customPatterns": ["this\\.\\s*(get|post|put|delete|patch)\\s*[<(]\\s*['\"]([^\"']+)"]
            },
            "backend": {
                "framework": "dotnet",
                "paths": ["src/Api/Controllers/"],
                "routePrefix": "api",
                "customPatterns": []
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Custom patterns **extend** (not replace) built-in framework patterns. Explicit config **overrides** auto-detected config for paths.

## Manual Run

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph connect-api --json
```

## Steps (when manually invoked)

1. **Run connector** via Bash:
    ```bash
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph connect-api --json
    ```
2. **Report results:** Frontend calls found, backend routes found, matches created, edge count

## Matching Strategies

The connector tries 5 strategies in order (highest confidence first):

| #   | Strategy         | Confidence | Example                                           |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Exact match      | 1.0        | FE `/api/users` = BE `/api/users`                 |
| 2   | Prefix-augmented | 0.95       | FE `/users` + prefix `api` → `/api/users`         |
| 3   | Suffix match     | 0.9        | BE `/api/users` stripped → `/users` = FE `/users` |
| 4   | Deep strip       | 0.85       | BE `/api/{param}/users` → `/users` = FE `/users`  |
| 5   | Deep strip both  | 0.8        | Both sides have `{param}` segments stripped       |

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
