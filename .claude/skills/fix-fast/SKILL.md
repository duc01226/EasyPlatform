> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

> **Estimation** — Modified Fibonacci: 1(trivial) → 2(small) → 3(medium) → 5(large) → 8(very large) → 13(epic, SHOULD split) → 21(MUST split). Output `story_points` and `complexity` in plan frontmatter. Complexity auto-derived: 1-2=Low, 3-5=Medium, 8=High, 13+=Critical.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Rapidly fix small, well-understood issues with minimal investigation overhead.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Quick root cause analysis from error message
2. **Fix** — Apply targeted fix directly
3. **Verify** — Run affected tests to confirm

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use for simple, isolated bugs only — escalate to `/fix-hard` for complex issues
- Minimize investigation time; if root cause isn't clear within minutes, escalate

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

## Mission

**Think hard** to analyze and fix these issues:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause analysis, MUST present findings + proposed fix to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

## Workflow

1. If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.
2. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
   2.5. Write root cause analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read before implementing fix.
3. Activate `debug-investigate` skills and `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for user approval.**
5. Start implementing the fix based the reports and solutions.
6. Use `tester` agent to test the fix and make sure it works, then report back to main agent.
7. If there are issues or failed tests, repeat from step 2.
8. After finishing, respond back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.

- **After fixing, MUST run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (fix applied). This ensures prove-fix, review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"/test"** — Run tests to verify fix
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MUST** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** READ the following files before starting:
    <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **MUST** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
      <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend.
      <!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
      <!-- SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
- **MUST** include `story_points` and `complexity` in plan frontmatter. SP > 8 = split.
