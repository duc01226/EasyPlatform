> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

>
> AI default behavior: see error at Place A → fix Place A. This is WRONG. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
>
> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**
>
> 1. **Trace full data flow** — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where the bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
> 2. **Identify the invariant owner** — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? That layer is responsible. Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant — not the highest layer that consumes it.
> 3. **One fix, maximum protection** — Ask: "If I fix here, does it protect ALL downstream consumers with ONE change?" If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
> 4. **Verify no bypass paths** — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for: direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Full data flow traced (origin → crash) `- [ ]` Invariant owner identified with `file:line` evidence `- [ ]` All access sites audited (grep count) `- [ ]` Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers)
>
> **Anti-patterns (REJECT these):**
>
> - "Fix it where it crashes" — Crash site ≠ cause site. Trace upstream.
> - "Add defensive checks at every consumer" — Scattered defense = wrong layer. One authoritative fix > many scattered guards.
> - "Both fix is safer" — Pick ONE authoritative layer. Redundant checks across layers send mixed signals about who owns the invariant.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Rapidly fix small, well-understood issues with minimal investigation overhead.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Quick root cause analysis from error message
2. **Fix** — Apply targeted fix directly
3. **Verify** — Run affected tests to confirm

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use for simple, isolated bugs only — escalate to `/fix-hard` for complex issues
- Minimize investigation time; if root cause isn't clear within minutes, escalate

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

## Mission

**Think hard** to analyze and fix these issues:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause analysis, MUST ATTENTION present findings + proposed fix to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

## Workflow

1. If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.
2. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
   2.5. Write root cause analysis to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read before implementing fix.
3. Activate `debug-investigate` skills and `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for user approval.**
5. Start implementing the fix based the reports and solutions.
6. Use `tester` agent to test the fix and make sure it works, then report back to main agent.
7. If there are issues or failed tests, repeat from step 2.
8. After finishing, respond back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.

- **After fixing, MUST ATTENTION run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

---

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (fix applied). This ensures prove-fix, review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"/test"** — Run tests to verify fix
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:
    <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
    <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend.
    <!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai` in plan/PBI frontmatter. Use SP table: SP 1=0.5d/0.25d, SP 2=1d/0.35d, SP 3=2d/0.65d, SP 5=4d/1.0d, SP 8=6d/1.5d · SP 13=10d/2.0d. SP 13 SHOULD split, SP 21 MUST split.
  <!-- /SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
  <!-- SYNC:fix-layer-accountability:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace full data flow and fix at the owning layer, not the crash site. Audit all access sites before adding `?.`.
    <!-- /SYNC:fix-layer-accountability:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.
    <!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.
    <!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
