description: '[Architecture] Full solution architecture: backend + frontend patterns, design patterns, library ecosystem, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, testing, code quality, dependency risk. Compare top 3 approaches per concern with recommendation.'
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, TaskCreate, AskUserQuestion
---

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** use `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY decision point — never assume user preferences.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** research top 3 options per architecture concern, compare with evidence, present report with recommendation + confidence %.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Act as a solution architect — research, critically analyze, and recommend the complete technical architecture for a project or feature. Cover ALL architecture concerns: backend, frontend, design patterns, library ecosystem, testing strategy, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, code quality, and dependency management. Produce a comprehensive comparison report with actionable recommendations.

**Workflow (12 steps):**

1. **Load Context** — Read domain model, tech stack, business evaluation, refined PBI
2. **Derive Architecture Requirements** — Map business/domain complexity to architecture constraints
3. **Backend Architecture** — Research top 3 backend architecture styles + design patterns
4. **Frontend Architecture** — Research top 3 frontend architecture styles + design patterns
5. **Library Ecosystem Research** — Best-practice libraries per concern (validation, caching, logging, utils, etc.)
6. **Testing Architecture** — Unit, integration, E2E, performance testing frameworks + strategy
7. **CI/CD & Deployment** — Pipeline design, containerization, orchestration, IaC
8. **Observability & Monitoring** — Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting stack
9. **Code Quality & Clean Code** — Linters, analyzers, formatters, enforcement tooling
10. **Dependency Risk Assessment** — Package health, obsolescence risk, maintenance cost
11. **Generate Report** — Full architecture decision report with all recommendations
12. **User Validation** — Present findings, ask 8-12 questions, confirm all decisions

**Key Rules:**

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** research minimum 3 options per architecture concern with web evidence
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** include confidence % with evidence for every recommendation
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** run user validation interview at end (never skip)
- Delegate to `solution-architect` agent for complex architecture decisions
- All claims must cite sources (URL, benchmark, case study, or codebase evidence)
- Never recommend based on familiarity alone — evidence required

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Step 1: Load Context

Read artifacts from prior workflow steps (search in `plans/` and `team-artifacts/`):

- Domain model / ERD (complexity, bounded contexts, aggregate count)
- Tech stack decisions (confirmed languages, frameworks, databases)
- Business evaluation (scale, constraints, compliance)
- Refined PBI (scope, acceptance criteria)
- Discovery interview (team skills, experience level)

Extract and summarize:

| Signal                  | Value        | Source           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Bounded contexts        | ...          | domain model     |
| Aggregate count         | ...          | domain model     |
| Cross-context events    | ...          | domain model     |
| Confirmed tech stack    | ...          | tech stack phase |
| Expected scale          | ...          | business eval    |
| Team architecture exp.  | ...          | discovery        |
| Compliance requirements | ...          | business eval    |
| Real-time needs         | Yes/No       | refined PBI      |
| Integration complexity  | Low/Med/High | domain model     |
| Deployment target       | ...          | business eval    |

---

## Step 2: Derive Architecture Requirements

Map signals to architecture constraints:

| Signal                      | Architecture Requirement                                  | Priority |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Many bounded contexts       | Clear module boundaries, context isolation                | Must     |
| High scale                  | Horizontal scaling, stateless services, caching strategy  | Must     |
| Complex domain              | Rich domain model, separation of domain from infra        | Must     |
| Cross-context events        | Event-driven communication, eventual consistency          | Must     |
| Small team                  | Low ceremony, fewer layers, convention over configuration | Should   |
| Compliance                  | Audit trail, immutable events, access control layers      | Must     |
| Real-time                   | Event sourcing or pub/sub, WebSocket/SSE support          | Should   |
| High integration complexity | Anti-corruption layers, adapter pattern, API gateway      | Should   |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** validate derived requirements with user via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding.

| Risk Level   | Criteria                                          | Action                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Low**      | Active, >3 maintainers, recent release, no CVEs   | Use freely                             |
| **Medium**   | 1-2 maintainers, release <6mo, minor CVEs patched | Use with monitoring plan               |
| **High**     | Single maintainer, >12mo stale, open CVEs         | Find alternative or plan exit strategy |
| **Critical** | Abandoned, unpatched CVEs, deprecated             | DO NOT USE — find replacement          |

### Dependency Maintenance Strategy

```markdown
### Recommended Practices

1. **Automated scanning:** {tool} (Dependabot/Renovate/Snyk) — weekly PR for updates
2. **Lock file strategy:** Commit lock files, pin major versions, allow patch auto-update
3. **Audit schedule:** Monthly `npm audit` / `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
4. **Vendor policy:** Max {N} dependencies per concern, prefer well-maintained alternatives
5. **Exit strategy:** For each High-risk dependency, document migration path to alternative
```

## Step 11: Generate Report

Write report to `{plan-dir}/research/architecture-design.md` with sections:

1. Executive summary (recommended architecture in 8-10 lines)
2. Architecture requirements table (from Step 2)
3. Backend architecture — style comparison + recommended patterns (Steps 3)
4. Frontend architecture — style comparison + recommended patterns (Step 4)
5. Library ecosystem — per-concern recommendations with alternatives (Step 5)
6. Testing architecture — pyramid, tools, coverage targets (Step 6)
7. CI/CD & deployment — pipeline design, deployment strategy (Step 7)
8. Observability stack — 3 pillars + alerting (Step 8)
9. Code quality — enforcement gates, tooling (Step 9)
10. Dependency risk matrix — high-risk packages, mitigation (Step 10)
11. Architecture diagram (Mermaid — showing all layers and data flow)
12. Risk assessment for overall architecture
13. Unresolved questions

## Step 12: User Validation Interview

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** present findings and ask 8-12 questions via `AskUserQuestion`:

### Required Questions

1. **Backend architecture** — "I recommend {style}. Agree?"
2. **Frontend architecture** — "I recommend {style} with {state management}. Agree?"
3. **Design patterns** — "Recommended backend patterns: {list}. Frontend patterns: {list}. Any to add/remove?"
4. **Key libraries** — "For {concern}, I recommend {lib} over {alternatives}. Agree?"
5. **Testing strategy** — "Test pyramid: {unit}%/{integration}%/{E2E}% using {frameworks}. Appropriate?"
6. **CI/CD** — "Pipeline: {tool} with {deployment strategy}. Fits your infra?"
7. **Observability** — "Monitoring stack: {logs}/{metrics}/{traces}. Sufficient?"
8. **Code quality** — "Enforcement: {linter + formatter + pre-commit hooks}. Team ready?"
9. **Dependency risk** — "Found {N} high-risk dependencies. Accept or find alternatives?"
10. **Complexity check** — "This architecture has {N} concerns addressed. Appropriate for team size?"

### Optional Deep-Dive Questions (pick 2-3)

- "Should we use event sourcing or traditional state-based persistence?"
- "Monolith-first or start with service boundaries?"
- "Micro frontends or monolith SPA?"
- "How important is framework independence for this project?"
- "Self-hosted observability or managed SaaS?"
- "Strict lint rules from day 1 or gradual adoption?"

After user confirms, update report with final decisions and mark as `status: confirmed`.

## Best Practices Audit (applied across all steps)

Validate architecture against these principles — flag violations in report:

| Principle                      | Check                                                      | Status |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Single Responsibility (S)**  | Each class/module has one reason to change                 | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Open/Closed (O)**            | Extensible without modifying existing code                 | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Liskov Substitution (L)**    | Subtypes substitutable for base types                      | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Interface Segregation (I)**  | No forced dependency on unused interfaces                  | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Dependency Inversion (D)**   | High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions | ✅/⚠️  |
| **DRY**                        | No duplicated business logic across layers                 | ✅/⚠️  |
| **KISS**                       | Simplest architecture that meets requirements              | ✅/⚠️  |
| **YAGNI**                      | No speculative layers or patterns for future needs         | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Separation of Concerns**     | Clear boundaries between domain, application, infra        | ✅/⚠️  |
| **IoC / Dependency Injection** | All dependencies injected, no `new` in business logic      | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Technical Agnosticism**      | Domain layer has zero framework/infra dependencies         | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Testability**                | Architecture supports unit + integration testing           | ✅/⚠️  |
| **12-Factor App**              | Config in env, stateless processes, port binding           | ✅/⚠️  |
| **Fail-Fast**                  | Validate early, fail with clear errors                     | ✅/⚠️  |
