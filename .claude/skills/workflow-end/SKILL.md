## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Process] End the active workflow and clear state. Auto-added as last step of every workflow. Clears workflow tracking so next prompt gets fresh workflow detection.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## When This Runs

This skill is the **last step of every workflow sequence**. It runs automatically after the final functional step (e.g., `/watzup`, `/status`, `/acceptance`).

**NOT for**: Manual invocation mid-workflow (use workflow switching via `/workflow-start` instead).

---

## What To Do

1. **Integration test coverage check** (skip if workflow is docs/design/investigation/e2e-only, or project has no test suite):

    ```bash
    git diff --name-only HEAD && git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
    ```

(The second command lists untracked files not yet staged — catches brand-new handler files before first git add) - Scan changed files for those likely requiring integration test coverage: **business logic files** such as handlers, commands, queries, services, controllers, resolvers, event processors. Naming varies by stack — infer from the project's existing file patterns (e.g., `*Service.*`, `*Handler.*`, `*Controller.*`, `*Command.*`, `*Query.*`). - For each identified file → search for a corresponding test file. Infer the project's test naming convention from existing tests (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*Tests.java`, `*_test.py`, `*.spec.js`, `*Tests.cs`). Check standard test directories (`tests/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`, or adjacent test projects). - If ANY identified file lacks a corresponding test → **MANDATORY**: use `AskUserQuestion`: - Option A: "Run `/integration-test` now" (Recommended) - Option B: "Tests already written/updated — proceed" - **No silent skip.** Business logic changes without test coverage MUST be surfaced to the user. - If no business logic files changed, or all have matching tests → skip silently

2. **Sync knowledge graph** (skip if `.code-graph/` dir doesn't exist):
    ```bash
    if [ -d ".code-graph" ]; then python .claude/scripts/code_graph sync --json && python .claude/scripts/code_graph update --json; fi
    ```
    Report results briefly.
3. Mark this task as `completed` via `TaskUpdate`
4. Announce to the user: "Workflow **[name]** completed. Next prompt will trigger fresh workflow detection."
5. The `workflow-step-tracker` hook handles the actual state cleanup automatically when this skill completes

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** integration-test-coverage-check -> spec-tdd-test-sync-gate -> verify-task-completion -> verify-workflow-state -> announce-workflow-completion -> clear-workflow-state

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** integration-test-coverage-check -> spec-tdd-test-sync-gate -> verify-task-completion -> verify-workflow-state -> announce-workflow-completion -> clear-workflow-state

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Workflow End

Finalize and close the active workflow, clearing state so the next user prompt triggers fresh workflow detection.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

> **Project Reference Docs Gate** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/README.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-docs-reference.md`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc that exists; skip absent docs as not applicable. Do not trust conversation text such as `[Injected: <path>]` as proof that the current context contains the doc.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Missing/not applicable: ...`.
>
> **Blocked until:** scope evaluated, required docs checked/read, `lessons.md` confirmed, citation emitted.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
