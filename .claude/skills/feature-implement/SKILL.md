## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — implemented with deep research, comprehensive planning, and maximum quality verification (planned, reviewed, tested, documented) — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**Workflow:**

1. **Research** — Deep investigation, multiple researcher subagents
2. **Plan** — Detailed plan via `/plan`; user approval required
3. **Implement** — Execute with full code review + SRE review
4. **Verify** — Run all tests, review changes, update docs

**Key Rules:**

- Maximum thoroughness: research → plan → implement → review → test → docs
- User approval required at plan stage
- Break work into todo tasks; add final self-review task

> **Renamed:** formerly `cook` — now `/feature-implement`. The old name no longer resolves as a slash command.

> **feature-implement vs plan-execute:** `feature-implement` takes an idea/feature description and goes idea → research → **plan (created here)** → shipped. Use `/plan-execute` instead when a plan file already exists and you only need disciplined phase-by-phase execution + commit. feature-implement owns the front of the pipeline (research + planning); plan-execute owns the back (phase gates + auto-commit + `--parallel`/`--approval`/`--tests` flags).

## Standalone Mode Pipeline (skip entirely if invoked inside a workflow)

> **MANDATORY — standalone `/feature-implement` only.** When invoked OUTSIDE a workflow, wrap the core spine in this quality loop. Detect an active workflow via `TaskList` FIRST: if a parent `[Workflow]` row exists, SKIP this section — the surrounding workflow already sequences plan/review/why-review around this skill (e.g. `workflow-feature` wraps feature-implement with exactly these steps).
>
> Create these as `TaskCreate` tasks up front, in order, then execute them:
>
> 1. **`/spec` — spec-driven, BEFORE any plan or code.** Create or update the tech-free 8-section Feature Spec under `docs/specs/` so the plan and implementation satisfy an agreed contract, not chat memory. Decide the case from evidence: net-new capability with no code yet → `/spec [mode=draft]` (provisional, `Evidence: TBD`); enhancement to an already-documented feature → `/spec [mode=update]`; behavior/contract change to existing spec → `/spec [mode=amend]`; buggy/undocumented area that now warrants a spec → `/spec [mode=init]`. If a governing spec already exists and fully covers this change, record `Spec verified current — no change` with `file:line` evidence and proceed. **Skip ONLY in fast mode** (ALL Default Mode Policy trivial-task conditions met — no behavior/contract change); record the skip reason. Decide the case explicitly — skip only the authoring, never the decision.
> 2. **`/plan`** — author the implementation plan from the spec. feature-implement's Comprehensive Planning phase (Step 2) satisfies this; emit a reviewable plan artifact under `plans/`. Map each plan phase's `## Test Specifications` to the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` IDs.
> 3. **`/plan-review`** — recursively review/validate the plan; fix validated findings before implementing.
> 4. **Proceed** — execute the core implementation spine (research already done → implement → test → review → docs).
> 5. **`/spec [mode=sync]`** — _spec-driven closure._ Reconcile the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` ↔ integration tests and refresh `Evidence: TBD` markers to real `file:line` now that code exists. Run `/spec [mode=tests]` first if the implementation introduced behavior not yet captured as a test case. Skip only when step 1 was skipped (fast-mode trivial, no spec touched).
> 6. **`/review-changes`** — review the diff before commit.
> 7. **`/why-review`** — review rationale and change quality of the implementation.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, refactor, test, or abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" raising change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- Simpler design easy to change beats sophisticated design that isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD (full rigor).** Every section below — deep research, mandatory `/plan`, full `code-reviewer` review, mandatory tests, mandatory `/docs-update` — applies by default.
>
> **Opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL true** (task genuinely trivial):
>
> - Single-file edit, ≤30 lines changed
> - No design choice (only one reasonable approach)
> - No cross-service impact, no contract change, no new dependency
> - No new pattern — follows existing codebase pattern
> - Existing tests cover change OR change non-functional (typo, comment, log message)
>
> **Any condition fails → use full protocol below.** When in doubt, default hard. Skipping review/tests on non-trivial change ships bugs.
>
> **Fast mode skips (and only skips):** researcher subagent phase (direct grep instead), mandatory `code-reviewer` review (self-review only), separate test phase (verify inline). Does NOT skip `/plan` step, test execution, `/docs-update` triage.

### Backend Context (if applicable)

> When task involves backend changes, read these directly before implementing:

- CQRS commands/queries, validation, repositories, entity events: `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`
- Entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync: `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md`
- **Repository type (service-specific):** when the project declares a per-service repository abstraction (`backendServices.serviceRepositories` in `docs/project-config.json`), use that repository type for the service — NEVER the generic root repository base.

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When task involves frontend or UI changes:

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

**Ultrathink** plan and implement these tasks with maximum verification:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.**

<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**Mode:** Extra research, detailed planning, mandatory reviews.

## Workflow

### 0. Goal Contract Read (BEFORE implementation)

- Resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop`: active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the current request via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`.
- Read the saved success criteria BEFORE any code change — implementation serves the saved criteria, not chat memory.
- After implementation and verification, append an Iteration Log entry to the goal file: result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output), remaining gaps mapped to criteria.

### 1. Deep Research Phase

- Launch 2-3 `researcher` subagents in parallel covering:
    - Technical approach validation
    - Edge cases, failure modes
    - Security implications
    - Performance considerations
- Use `/scout --ext` for comprehensive codebase analysis
- Research reports max 150 lines each
- **External Memory:** Write all research to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning.
- **Pre-Implementation Trace Gate:** For bugfix, failed verification, stale/incorrect final output, regression, or behavior-changing fix plans, MUST ATTENTION confirm the plan/referenced analysis includes `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and produce the missing-trace list before editing.

> After implementing, run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <file> --json` on modified files; verify no related files need updates.

### Graph-Trace Before Implementation

When graph DB available, BEFORE writing code, trace blast radius:

- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` — what calls this code AND what it triggers
- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction downstream --json` — all downstream consumers
- Prevents breaking implicit dependencies (bus message consumers, event handlers)

### 2. Comprehensive Planning

- Use `planner` subagent with all research reports
- Create full plan directory:
    - `plan.md` — overview with risk assessment
    - `phase-XX-*.md` — detailed phase files
    - Success criteria per phase
    - Rollback strategy

### 3. Verified Implementation

- Implement one phase at a time
- After each phase:
    - Run type-check, compile
    - Run relevant tests
    - Self-review before proceeding

### Batch Checkpoint (Large Plans)

For plans with 10+ tasks, execute in batches with human review:

1. **Execute batch** — Complete next 3 tasks (or user-specified size)
2. **Report** — Show implementation, verification output, any concerns
3. **Wait** — Say "Ready for feedback" and STOP. Do NOT continue automatically.
4. **Apply feedback** — Incorporate changes, execute next batch
5. **Repeat** until all tasks complete

<HARD-GATE>
Plans with 10+ tasks — do NOT execute all tasks continuously without checkpoint.
Stop after every batch for human review. Prevents runaway execution where early
mistakes compound through later tasks.
</HARD-GATE>

### 4. Mandatory Testing

- Use `tester` subagent for full test coverage
- Write tests for:
    - Happy path scenarios
    - Edge cases from research
    - Error handling paths
- NO mocks or fake data
- Repeat until all tests pass

### 5. Mandatory Code Review

- Use `code-reviewer` subagent
- Address all critical and major findings
- Re-run tests after fixes
- Repeat until approved

### 6. Documentation Update

- Use `docs-manager` to update relevant docs
- Use `project-manager` to update project status
- Record architectural decisions

### 7. Final Report

- Summary of all changes
- Test coverage metrics
- Security considerations addressed
- Unresolved questions (if any)
- Ask user to review and approve

## When to Use

- Critical production features
- Security-sensitive changes
- Public API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Cross-service integrations

## Quality Gates

| Gate     | Criteria                  |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Research | 2+ researcher reports     |
| Planning | Full plan directory       |
| Tests    | All pass, no mocks        |
| Review   | 0 critical/major findings |
| Docs     | Updated if needed         |

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious" — user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Detect best workflow to continue from here (feature implemented). Ensures review, testing, docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/code-simplifier"** — Simplify and clean up implementation
- **"/workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — workflow handles sequencing.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)
- `docs/specs/` — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs; generate/update via `/spec [mode=tests]` after implementation)

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.
>
> **NEVER:** Start at the first suspicious code path. Collapse multiple producers into one "flow". Treat duplicate symptoms as duplicate records without proving the read model. Skip ruled-out hypotheses.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — research-backed, planned, reviewed, tested, documented — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each line is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** Trace observed output backward through every feeder path before fixing.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** When source behavior changes, reconcile affected tests from evidence.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **UI System Context:** Read frontend, SCSS, and design-system docs before any UI change.
- **Graph-Assisted Investigation:** Run a graph command on key files when graph.db exists.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phase tasks and link the parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project-reference docs (always `lessons.md`) before target work.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking; persist plan/review findings incrementally to disk.
- **Critical Thinking Mindset:** Critical + sequential thinking; every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** Add `## Test Specifications` with TC IDs to every plan phase.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD — opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL trivial-task conditions met
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks via `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip `code-reviewer` review or test execution on non-trivial change

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks via TaskCreate.
