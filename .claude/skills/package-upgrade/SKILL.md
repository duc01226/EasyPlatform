# Frontend Package Upgrade Analysis & Planning

You are to operate as an expert frontend package management specialist, npm ecosystem analyst, and software architecture expert to analyze package.json files, research latest versions, collect breaking changes and migration guides, and generate a comprehensive upgrade plan.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

## Core Anti-Hallucination Protocols

### ASSUMPTION_VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT
Before every major operation:
1. "What assumptions am I making about [X]?"
2. "Have I verified this with actual code evidence?"
3. "Could I be wrong about [specific pattern/relationship]?"

### EVIDENCE_CHAIN_VALIDATION
Before claiming any relationship:
- "I believe package X is compatible because..." → show actual compatibility matrix
- "This version has breaking changes because..." → cite official changelog
- "Migration effort is Y hours because..." → show evidence from similar migrations

### TOOL_EFFICIENCY_PROTOCOL
- Batch multiple WebSearch calls for related packages
- Use parallel Read operations for package.json files
- Batch package research into groups of 10

### CONTEXT_ANCHOR_SYSTEM
Every 10 packages researched:
1. Re-read the original task description
2. Verify the current operation aligns with original goals
3. Update the `Current Focus` in `## Progress` section

---

## PHASE 1: PACKAGE INVENTORY & CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

Build package inventory in `ai_task_analysis_notes/frontend-package-upgrade-analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND PACKAGE DISCOVERY

Initialize analysis file with:
- `## Metadata` - Original prompt and task description
- `## Progress` - Track phase, items processed, total items
- `## Package Inventory` - All package.json files and dependencies
- `## Version Research Results` - Latest versions and changelogs
- `## Breaking Changes Analysis` - Breaking changes catalog
- `## Migration Complexity Assessment` - Risk levels and effort estimates
- `## Upgrade Strategy` - Phased migration plan

**Find all package.json files**:
```
src/PlatformExampleAppWeb/package.json
src/PlatformExampleAppWeb/apps/*/package.json
src/PlatformExampleAppWeb/libs/*/package.json
```

For each package.json, document:
- Project Name & Location
- Framework Version
- Dependencies (categorized: Framework, UI, Build Tools, Testing, Utilities)
- DevDependencies

Create **Master Package List** consolidating all unique packages.

### PHASE 1B: PACKAGE USAGE ANALYSIS

For each unique package, analyze codebase usage:
- **Projects Using**: Which projects depend on this
- **Import Count**: Number of files importing
- **Key Usage Areas**: Where primarily used
- **Configuration Files**: Config files for this package
- **Upgrade Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High/Critical based on usage breadth

---

## PHASE 2: WEB RESEARCH & VERSION DISCOVERY

**IMPORTANT: BATCH INTO GROUPS OF 10**

For EACH package in Master Package List:

### Latest Version Discovery
- Search: "[package-name] npm latest version"
- Check: https://www.npmjs.com/package/[package-name]
- Extract: Latest stable version, release date, downloads

### Breaking Changes Research
- Search: "[package-name] migration guide [old-version] to [new-version]"
- Search: "[package-name] v[X] breaking changes"
- Search: "[package-name] changelog"
- GitHub: Check CHANGELOG.md, releases

### Ecosystem Compatibility
- Angular version compatibility
- Check peerDependencies
- Cross-package dependencies

Document:
- Current vs. Latest versions
- Version gap (major/minor/patch versions behind)
- Breaking changes with migration steps
- Deprecation warnings
- Peer dependency changes

---

## PHASE 3: RISK ASSESSMENT & PRIORITIZATION

### Risk Categories
- **Critical Risk**: 5+ major versions behind, framework packages, 50+ breaking changes
- **High Risk**: 3-4 major versions, state management, 20-30 breaking changes
- **Medium Risk**: 1-2 major versions, some breaking changes
- **Low Risk**: Patch/minor updates, backward compatible

### Dependency Graph (Upgrade Order)
1. Foundation packages (Node.js, TypeScript)
2. Framework packages (Angular Core, CLI)
3. Framework extensions (Material, RxJS)
4. Third-party libraries
5. Dev tools last

---

## PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE REPORT GENERATION

Generate report at `ai_package_upgrade_reports/[YYYY-MM-DD]-frontend-package-upgrade-report.md`:

### Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Package Inventory by Project**
3. **Version Gap Analysis**
4. **Breaking Changes Catalog**
5. **Migration Complexity Assessment**
6. **Ecosystem Compatibility Analysis**
7. **Recommended Upgrade Strategy** (Phased Migration Plan)
8. **Detailed Migration Guides**
9. **Testing Strategy**
10. **Rollback Plan**
11. **Timeline & Resource Estimation**
12. **Appendices**

---

## PHASE 5: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present comprehensive package upgrade report for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 6: CONFIDENCE DECLARATION

Before marking complete, provide:

### Solution Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: [High 90-100% / Medium 70-89% / Low <70%]

**Evidence Summary**:
- All package.json files discovered: [count]
- Web research completed: [X/Y packages]
- Breaking changes documented: [count]
- Official sources used: npm, GitHub, official docs

**Assumptions Made**: [List or "None"]

**User Confirmation Needed**:
- IF confidence < 90%: "Please verify [specific packages] before proceeding"
- IF confidence >= 90%: "Analysis is comprehensive, ready for migration"

---

## Package Upgrade Guidelines

- **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find ALL package.json files
- **Web Research Accuracy**: Use official sources only (npm, GitHub, official docs)
- **Breaking Changes Focus**: Prioritize identifying breaking changes requiring code changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate complexity based on breaking changes, usage breadth, dependencies
- **Practical Planning**: Create actionable phased plan with realistic effort estimates
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Base ALL recommendations on actual research with sources cited
- **Confidence Declaration**: Declare confidence level; if < 90%, request user confirmation
- **Batch Processing**: Research packages in batches of 10
