## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Investigate, identify root cause with `file:line` evidence. Investigation-only — hand off to `/fix` for implementation.

**Workflow:**

1. **Classify** — Detect bug scenario type (Phase 0) → route to specialized agent
2. **Reproduce** — Confirm expected vs actual with evidence
3. **Hypothesize** — Form 2-3 ranked theories
4. **Trace** — Follow code paths; collect `file:line` proof per hypothesis
5. **Confirm** — Single root cause explains ALL symptoms
6. **Validate** — Fresh Eyes round 2 before declaring confirmed
7. **Report** — Confidence-tagged finding + hand off to `/fix`

**Key Rules:**

- NEVER patch symptoms — trace full call chain, fix at owning layer
- NEVER report root cause without `file:line` evidence
- NEVER declare confirmed root cause after Round 1 alone (Fresh Eyes required)
- Output: confirmed root cause OR "hypothesis, not confirmed" + evidence gaps

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

## Phase 0: Classify Bug Scenario (BLOCKING — Do Before ANY Investigation)

**Think:** What type of failure is this? Classification routes to the right agent and determines which evidence matters most.

| Bug Type                    | Signals                                                 | Specialized Agent                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Frontend UI / rendering     | Console errors, visual regression, component state      | `debugger`                         |
| Backend logic / data        | Wrong API response, data corruption, validation failure | `debugger`                         |
| Cross-service / message bus | Events not propagating, consumer failures, sync lag     | `debugger` + graph trace MANDATORY |
| Performance / memory        | Slow queries, OOM, N+1, unbounded result sets           | `performance-optimizer`            |
| Security / auth             | Access denied, token issues, permission bypass          | `security-auditor`                 |

**Cross-service bugs:** Run graph trace FIRST — grep alone misses implicit bus connections.
**OOM / memory exhaustion:** Check row COUNT before row SIZE. Unbounded query loading thousands of records is the more common cause. Triage: (1) missing DB-level filter? (2) excessive row size?

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Skeptical. Sequential. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.**

- NEVER assume first hypothesis correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim MUST include `file:line` evidence
- Cannot prove root cause → state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Challenge assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Other contributing factors?" → check related code paths

## Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` + evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.

| Confidence | Meaning                                  | Action                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 95-100%    | Full trace verified                      | Report as confirmed root cause       |
| 80-94%     | Main path verified, edge cases uncertain | Report with caveats                  |
| 60-79%     | Partial trace                            | Report as hypothesis                 |
| <60%       | Insufficient evidence                    | DO NOT report — gather more evidence |

## Investigation Dimensions

Reason through each dimension — state what fails if weak, then apply with evidence.

### Dim 1: Reproduce

**Think:** What exact conditions trigger this? Data state? User action? Timing? Environment delta?

- Confirm issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
- Identify trigger: user action, data state, timing, env difference

### Dim 2: Hypothesize

**Think:** Given symptoms, what are the most plausible failure modes? What would confirm vs contradict each?

- Form 2-3 theories ranked by likelihood
- Note evidence needed to confirm/contradict each theory before investigating

### Dim 3: Trace

**Think:** Where does bad state ENTER the system — not where it CRASHES? Which layer owns this invariant?

- Find entry point (API, UI, job, event)
- Follow through handlers/services/transformations
- Check error handling paths
- Collect `file:line` evidence per hypothesis
- Use graph trace for implicit connections (event handlers, bus consumers)

### Dim 4: Confirm

**Think:** Does this root cause explain ALL symptoms? Are there bypass paths that skip the fix point?

- Match evidence to single root cause
- Verify root cause explains ALL observed symptoms
- Check secondary contributing factors
- Verify no bypass paths (direct construction, clone/spread without re-validation, mutations outside model layer)

### Dim 5: Report

- Output: confirmed root cause + evidence chain
- Include: affected files, data flow summary, fix recommendation
- Hand off to `/fix` for implementation

## Dependency Tracing (MANDATORY when graph.db exists)

**MUST ATTENTION** use structural queries — graph reveals ALL callers/consumers grep misses.

```bash
# Who calls the buggy function
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <function> --json

# Who imports the buggy module
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <file> --json

# What tests exist
python .claude/scripts/code_graph query tests_for <function> --json

# Full upstream + downstream context
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <suspect-file> --direction both --json

# Callers only (find all trigger points)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <suspect-file> --direction upstream --json
```

Graph reveals implicit connections (MESSAGE_BUS, event handlers) that propagate issues across services — invisible to grep.

## Root Cause Validation (Fresh Eyes Protocol)

NEVER declare confirmed root cause after Round 1 alone. Main agent rationalizes its own findings — a zero-memory sub-agent catches what main agent dismissed.

**Round 1 (main agent):** Identify root cause + full evidence chain. Write findings to report file.

**Round 2 (fresh `debugger` sub-agent, zero memory of Round 1):** Spawn with:

- Suspected root cause statement
- All `file:line` evidence collected
- Ask: "Does this evidence conclusively prove the stated root cause, or are there gaps?"

**Decision:**

- Sub-agent CONFIRMS → declare confirmed, proceed to `/fix`
- Sub-agent finds GAPS → collect additional evidence, repeat
- 2 rounds without confirmation → STOP, escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion`

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Post-Fix Verification

After `/fix` applies changes, `/prove-fix` MUST be run — builds code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Non-negotiable in all fix workflows.

| "Just try changing X and see"          | One hypothesis at a time. Scientific method, not trial and error.               |
| "Already tried 2+ fixes, one more"     | 3+ failed fixes = STOP. Question the architecture, not the fix.                 |
| "The error message is misleading"      | Read it again carefully. Error messages are usually right.                      |
| "It works on my machine"               | Reproduce in the failing environment. Your environment hides bugs.              |
| "This can't be the cause"              | Verify with evidence, not intuition. Unlikely causes are still causes.          |
| "It's OOM, must be a large object"     | Check row COUNT before row SIZE. Unbounded query > large single row.            |
| "Round 2 fresh agent unnecessary"      | Main agent rationalizes its own findings. Zero-memory agent catches dismissals. |
| "Graph.db not needed for this bug"     | Cross-service bugs are invisible to grep. Run trace first.                      |

## Workflow Recommendation

**MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** Not in workflow? Use `AskUserQuestion`:

1. **Activate `bugfix` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → debug → plan → fix → prove-fix → review → test
2. **Execute `/debug-investigate` directly** — standalone

---

## Next Steps (Standalone only — skip if inside workflow)

**MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` after completing. NEVER auto-decide next step:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — detect best workflow to continue from here
- **"/fix"** — apply fix based on debug findings
- **"/plan"** — if fix requires planning first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

**Standalone Review Gate:** Outside workflow? MUST create `/review-changes` task as LAST task.

> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Closing Reminders

**MUST ATTENTION** Phase 0 FIRST — classify bug type, route to specialized agent (`performance-optimizer` / `security-auditor`) before any investigation
**MUST ATTENTION** NEVER fix at crash site — trace full data flow, fix at invariant-owning layer
**MUST ATTENTION** NEVER report root cause without `file:line` evidence; Confidence <60% = DO NOT recommend
**MUST ATTENTION** NEVER declare confirmed root cause after Round 1 alone — Fresh Eyes Protocol required
**MUST ATTENTION** run graph trace when graph.db exists — reveals bus consumers and event handlers grep cannot see
**MUST ATTENTION** OOM → check row COUNT before row SIZE; 3+ failed fixes → STOP, escalate to user
**MUST ATTENTION** `TaskCreate` before starting; `/prove-fix` MUST run after `/fix` applies changes

**Anti-Rationalization:**
