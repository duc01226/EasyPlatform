## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze market landscape with competitive analysis, sizing, trends, SWOT, and customer segmentation.

**Workflow:**

1. **Define scope** — Industry, geography, segment, timeframe
2. **Research competitors** — WebSearch for players, positioning, strengths/weaknesses
3. **Size the market** — TAM/SAM/SOM from industry reports
4. **Identify trends** — Growth drivers, disruptions, regulatory changes
5. **SWOT analysis** — Synthesize Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats
6. **Segment customers** — Demographics, psychographics, jobs-to-be-done

**Key Rules:**

- Prefer Tier 1-2 sources for market sizing
- Every market size claim must cite source + methodology
- SWOT items linked to evidence, not speculation

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Market Analysis

## Step 1: Define Market Scope

Clarify with user:

- **Industry/vertical** — What market segment?
- **Geography** — Global, regional, or local?
- **Timeframe** — Current state? 3-year projection?
- **Focus** — B2B, B2C, or both?

## Step 2: Competitive Research

For each competitor (identify 5-10):

| Field                       | Source                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Company name                | WebSearch                    |
| Positioning/tagline         | Company website              |
| Key products                | Product pages                |
| Pricing model               | Pricing page or reports      |
| Strengths                   | Reviews, analyst reports     |
| Weaknesses                  | Reviews, customer complaints |
| Market share (if available) | Industry reports             |

## Step 3: Market Sizing

Use Tier 1-2 sources (Gartner, Statista, IBISWorld, government data):

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) — Maximum possible revenue if 100% market share
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) — Portion accessible given constraints
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) — Realistic capture in 3 years

Every number must cite: source, year, methodology.

## Step 4: Trend Analysis

Research and categorize:

- **Growth drivers** — What's fueling market growth?
- **Disruptions** — Technology shifts, new entrants, business model innovations
- **Regulatory** — New laws, compliance requirements, policy changes
- **Consumer behavior** — Changing preferences, demographics shifts

## Step 5: SWOT Analysis

Each item must link to evidence:

| Category        | Item   | Evidence   |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **Strength**    | {item} | Source [N] |
| **Weakness**    | {item} | Source [N] |
| **Opportunity** | {item} | Source [N] |
| **Threat**      | {item} | Source [N] |

## Step 6: Customer Segmentation

For each segment:

- **Demographics** — Age, role, income, company size
- **Psychographics** — Values, pain points, aspirations
- **Behavior** — Buying patterns, media consumption
- **Jobs-to-be-Done** — What are they trying to accomplish?

## Output

Market analysis is typically consumed by:

- `strategy-builder` skill (marketing strategy)
- `business-evaluation` skill (business viability)

Write findings to working file or inline with consuming skill's output.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** Apply critical + sequential thinking; trace proof for every claim; confidence >80% to act.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
