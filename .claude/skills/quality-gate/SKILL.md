description: '[Code Quality] Run quality gate checklist. Use for pre-release, pre-dev, or pre-QA quality verification.'

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before executing.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Verify readiness criteria before proceeding to next phase.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine gate type (pre-dev, pre-QA, pre-release)
2. **Check** — Run gate-specific checklist items
3. **Report** — PASS/FAIL with evidence per criterion

**Key Rules:**

- Output must be PASS or FAIL with specific evidence
- Never skip checklist items — mark as N/A if not applicable
- Block progression on FAIL — list blocking items

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Gate Types & Checklists

### Pre-Development Gate

- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and clear
- [ ] Dependencies identified and available
- [ ] Design specs available (if UI work)
- [ ] No blocking questions unresolved
- [ ] Story points assigned (Fibonacci 1-21, see `.claude/skills/shared/estimation-framework.md`)

### Pre-QA Gate

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Test data prepared

### Pre-Release Gate

- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md up-to-date
- [ ] No critical/major open bugs
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date
- [ ] Rollback strategy defined

## Output Format

```
## Quality Gate Result

**Gate Type:** [Pre-Dev | Pre-QA | Pre-Release]
**Verdict:** PASS | FAIL
**Date:** {date}

### Checklist

- [pass] [Item] — [evidence]
- [fail] [Item] — [reason for failure]
- N/A [Item] — [why not applicable]

### Blocking Items (if FAIL)
1. [Specific item that must be resolved]
```

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

## Workflow Recommendation

> **IMPORTANT MUST:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user:
>
> 1. **Activate `pre-development` workflow** (Recommended) — quality-gate → plan → plan-review → plan-validate
> 2. **Execute `/quality-gate` directly** — run this skill standalone
