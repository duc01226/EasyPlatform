description: '[Code Quality] Run quality gate checklist. Use for pre-release, pre-dev, or pre-QA quality verification.'

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

> **Understand Code First** — Search codebase for 3+ similar implementations BEFORE writing any code. Read existing files, validate assumptions with grep evidence, map dependencies via graph trace. Never invent new patterns when existing ones work.
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` for full protocol and checklists.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)

> **Graph Impact Analysis** — Use `trace --direction downstream` on changed files to find all impacted consumers, bus message handlers, event subscribers. Verify each needs updating.
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/graph-impact-analysis-protocol.md` for full protocol and checklists.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Verify readiness criteria before proceeding to next phase.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine gate type (pre-dev, pre-QA, pre-release)
2. **Check** — Run gate-specific checklist items
3. **Report** — PASS/FAIL with evidence per criterion

**Key Rules:**

- Output must be PASS or FAIL with specific evidence
- Never skip checklist items — mark as N/A if not applicable
- Block progression on FAIL — list blocking items

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

> **UI System Context** — For frontend/UI/styling tasks, MUST READ these BEFORE implementing: `frontend-patterns-reference.md` (component base classes, stores, forms), `scss-styling-guide.md` (BEM methodology, SCSS vars, responsive), `design-system/README.md` (design tokens, component inventory, icons).
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/ui-system-context.md` for full protocol and checklists.

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

## Gate Types & Checklists

### Pre-Development Gate

- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and clear
- [ ] Dependencies identified and available
- [ ] Design specs available (if UI work)
- [ ] No blocking questions unresolved
- [ ] Story points assigned (Fibonacci 1-21, see `.claude/skills/shared/estimation-framework.md`)

### Pre-QA Gate

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Test data prepared

### Pre-Release Gate

- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md up-to-date
- [ ] No critical/major open bugs
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date
- [ ] Rollback strategy defined

### Database Performance Gate (ALL gate types)

> **[IMPORTANT] Database Performance Protocol (MANDATORY):**
>
> 1. **Paging Required** — ALL list/collection queries MUST use pagination. NEVER load all records into memory. Verify: no unbounded `GetAll()`, `ToList()`, or `Find()` without `Skip/Take` or cursor-based paging.
> 2. **Index Required** — ALL query filter fields, foreign keys, and sort columns MUST have database indexes configured. Verify: entity expressions match index field order, database collections have index management methods, migrations include indexes for WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY columns.

- [ ] All list queries use pagination (no unbounded GetAll/ToList)
- [ ] Query filter fields have matching database indexes
- [ ] Foreign keys have database indexes configured
- [ ] Sort columns have database indexes configured

## Output Format

```
## Quality Gate Result

**Gate Type:** [Pre-Dev | Pre-QA | Pre-Release]
**Verdict:** PASS | FAIL
**Date:** {date}

### Checklist

- [pass] [Item] — [evidence]
- [fail] [Item] — [reason for failure]
- N/A [Item] — [why not applicable]

### Blocking Items (if FAIL)
1. [Specific item that must be resolved]
```

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

## Workflow Recommendation

> **IMPORTANT MUST:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user:
>
> 1. **Activate `pre-development` workflow** (Recommended) — quality-gate → plan → plan-review → plan-validate
> 2. **Execute `/quality-gate` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
