> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first -->

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)

<!-- SYNC:graph-impact-analysis -->

> **Graph Impact Analysis** — When `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, run `blast-radius --json` to detect ALL files affected by changes (7 edge types: CALLS, MESSAGE_BUS, API_ENDPOINT, TRIGGERS_EVENT, PRODUCES_EVENT, TRIGGERS_COMMAND_EVENT, INHERITS). Compute gap: impacted_files - changed_files = potentially stale files. Risk: <5 Low, 5-20 Medium, >20 High. Use `trace --direction downstream` for deep chains on high-impact files.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Verify readiness criteria before proceeding to next phase.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine gate type (pre-dev, pre-QA, pre-release)
2. **Check** — Run gate-specific checklist items
3. **Report** — PASS/FAIL with evidence per criterion

**Key Rules:**

- Output must be PASS or FAIL with specific evidence
- Never skip checklist items — mark as N/A if not applicable
- Block progression on FAIL — list blocking items

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

## Gate Types & Checklists

### Pre-Development Gate

- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and clear
- [ ] Dependencies identified and available
- [ ] Design specs available (if UI work)
- [ ] No blocking questions unresolved
- [ ] Story points assigned (Fibonacci 1-21: 1=trivial, 2=small, 3=medium, 5=large, 8=very large, 13=epic SHOULD split, 21=MUST ATTENTION split)

### Pre-QA Gate

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Test data prepared

### Pre-Release Gate

- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md up-to-date
- [ ] No critical/major open bugs
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date
- [ ] Rollback strategy defined

### Database Performance Gate (ALL gate types)

> **[IMPORTANT] Database Performance Protocol (MANDATORY):**
>
> 1. **Paging Required** — ALL list/collection queries MUST ATTENTION use pagination. NEVER load all records into memory. Verify: no unbounded `GetAll()`, `ToList()`, or `Find()` without `Skip/Take` or cursor-based paging.
> 2. **Index Required** — ALL query filter fields, foreign keys, and sort columns MUST ATTENTION have database indexes configured. Verify: entity expressions match index field order, database collections have index management methods, migrations include indexes for WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY columns.

- [ ] All list queries use pagination (no unbounded GetAll/ToList)
- [ ] Query filter fields have matching database indexes
- [ ] Foreign keys have database indexes configured
- [ ] Sort columns have database indexes configured

## Output Format

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `pre-development` workflow** (Recommended) — quality-gate → plan → plan-review → plan-validate
> 2. **Execute `/quality-gate` directly** — run this skill standalone
