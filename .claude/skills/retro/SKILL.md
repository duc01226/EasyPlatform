## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Facilitate sprint retrospective with structured feedback collection.

**Workflow:**

1. **What went well** — Collect positive outcomes, wins, good practices
2. **What didn't go well** — Identify pain points, blockers, frustrations
3. **Action items** — Concrete improvements for next sprint
4. **Metrics** — Sprint velocity, completion rate, bug count

**Key Rules:**

- Focus on process improvements, not blame
- Every "didn't go well" should have a proposed action item
- Action items must be specific, assignable, and time-bound
- Output to plans/reports/ directory

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Retrospective Structure

### 1. Data Gathering

- Review sprint status report (if available from `/status`)
- Collect git activity: commits, PRs merged, branches
- Review task completion rate

### 2. What Went Well

- Identify practices worth continuing
- Celebrate wins and improvements from previous action items

### 3. What Didn't Go Well

- Identify friction points, blockers, delays
- Look for patterns across multiple sprints
- No blame — focus on systemic issues

### 4. Action Items

Each action item must have:

- **Description** — What needs to change
- **Owner** — Who is responsible
- **Deadline** — When it should be addressed
- **Success criteria** — How we know it's done

## Output Format

```
## Sprint Retrospective

**Sprint:** [Sprint name/number]
**Date:** {date}
**Output:** plans/reports/retro-{date}-{sprint}.md

### What Went Well
- [Positive item]

### What Didn't Go Well
- [Pain point] → Action: [proposed fix]

### Action Items
| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Action] | [Who] | [When] | Pending |

### Metrics
- Planned: X items | Completed: Y | Completion rate: Z%
```

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
