## Quick Summary

> **Portability:** `docs/specs/` is the fixed Feature Spec root.

**Goal:** Generate, on demand, a regenerable single-writer navigation layer (catalog + cross-capability ERD + rebuild guide) **assembled FROM** the canonical tech-free 8-section Feature Specs under `docs/specs/{Bucket}/` — so a bucket can be browsed or replatformed without ever forking a second, hand-maintained source of truth. The Feature Specs are the source of truth; this skill only assembles regenerable aids over them.

> **Renamed:** repurposes the former `/spec-discovery` skill (v4.0.0 derived-aid rewrite) — `/spec-discovery` no longer resolves as a slash command; use `/spec-index`.

> **[SCOPE]** This skill assembles a **DERIVED** index / ERD / reimplementation guide over the canonical Feature Specs. It MUST NOT emit a per-module A-E engineering bundle (`A-domain-model`, `B-business-rules`, `C-api-contracts`, `D-events`, `E-user-journeys`), `M##` directories, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, or `06-reimplementation-guide.md` — those are not part of the spec model; their content lives in the Feature Spec (thin-index-only contract: output is DERIVED — never emit A-E bundle files). Authority: [`docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`](../../../docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md).

**Inputs:** the canonical 8-section Feature Specs (§1 Overview, §5 Domain Model Mermaid, §8 TCs). Code is the technical source of truth — read it ONLY to resolve cross-spec ERD relationships or a reimplementation build order, never to populate a parallel spec layer.

**Modes:**

| Mode    | Trigger                            | Input                                           | Output                                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index` | default — refresh derived aids     | Feature Specs in the target bucket(s)           | `INDEX.md` catalog (+ optional ERD / reimplementation guide), all DERIVED |
| `audit` | explicit request — staleness check | Feature Spec mtimes/git vs derived-artifact age | Stale-list report (which derived aids lag their source specs)             |

**Workflow:** `/scout` (locate specs) → `/spec-index` (assemble derived aids) → `/review-changes` → `/watzup`

**Key Rules:**

- **[BLOCKING]** Output is **DERIVED and regenerable** — every generated file carries a `> DERIVED — regenerate via /spec-index; do NOT hand-edit` banner. It is NEVER a second source of truth.
- **[BLOCKING]** MUST NOT emit `M##` dirs, `A-E` files, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, `06-reimplementation-guide.md`, `docs/specs/README.md`, or `docs/specs/PRIORITY-INDEX.md` (all retired). See **Hard Prohibitions**.
- §1-7 of a Feature Spec are tech-free; the derived INDEX/ERD inherit that. The **reimplementation guide is the sole artifact allowed to name a target stack** (it is a rebuild guide — `spec-principles.md` §3 exception).
- Every catalog row / ERD entity links back to the source Feature Spec; mark `[UNVERIFIED]` rather than guessing.
- Read [`docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md`](../../../docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md) §3 (tech-agnostic + banned-token list) before writing any prose.

## App Bucket Mapping

Derived aids are organized by **App Bucket** (matches the single-home spec tree). Resolve service→bucket assignments from the canonical table in [`docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`](../../../docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md) → **App Bucket Mapping** — do not inline project-specific bucket names in this skill.

---

## Step 0 — Scope Gate (MANDATORY FIRST)

Before reading anything, use `AskUserQuestion`. Confirm:

| Dimension      | Question                                                                                                  | Auto-Default    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Bucket** ★   | Which App Bucket(s) — one bucket, several, or all of `docs/specs/`?                                       | — must confirm  |
| **Mode** ★     | `index` (regenerate derived aids) OR `audit` (report which derived aids are stale vs their source specs)? | `index`         |
| **Artifacts**  | Which derived aids: bucket `INDEX.md` / cross-capability ERD / reimplementation guide?                    | `INDEX.md` only |
| **Stack note** | (reimplementation guide only) Name a target rebuild stack, or keep stack-neutral build order?             | Stack-neutral   |

> **[BLOCKING]** If the target bucket has **no** Feature Specs matching `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.*.md`, STOP and route the user to `/spec` — there is nothing to derive from. NEVER fabricate a spec to index.

---

## Step 1 — Read the Source Feature Specs

1. `Glob docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.*.md` → enumerate the canonical specs.
2. For each spec, read and extract ONLY:
    - **Capability name** + file link
    - **Summary** — first sentence of `## 1. Overview`
    - **Feature code** + **TC count** + status mix from `## 8. Test Specifications`
    - **Entities + relationships** from the `## 5. Domain Model` ` ```mermaid ` block (for ERD assembly)
3. Do NOT re-derive business rules, API contracts, or events into new files — those live in the Feature Spec (§1-7) and in code. You are indexing, not extracting.

> **Scale note:** For a bucket with many specs, you MAY spawn parallel reader sub-agents (one per spec) that each return the extracted fields above. This is an optimization, not a gate — there is no per-module A-E extraction to parallelize anymore.

---

## Step 2 — Assemble the Derived Aids

### 2a. Bucket `INDEX.md` (default)

Regenerate `docs/specs/{Bucket}/INDEX.md` as a feature catalog:

```markdown
> **DERIVED — regenerate via `/spec-index`; do NOT hand-edit.** Source of truth: the Feature Specs in `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.*.md`.

# {Bucket} — Feature Index

| Capability                 | Summary             | Feature Code | TCs | Status         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --- | -------------- |
| [{Name}](README.{Name}.md) | {one-line overview} | {FC}         | {n} | {Active/Draft} |
```

> `/spec` owns the canonical Feature Specs only. `/spec-index` owns this derived `INDEX.md` and regenerates it deterministically from the specs, so there is one writer for the derived navigation file.

### 2b. Cross-Capability ERD (on request)

Assemble one Mermaid `erDiagram` from every spec's §5 block in the bucket:

- Merge entities; dedupe by name; keep cross-capability relationships.
- Resolve a relationship only present implicitly in code by reading the code — but the ERD stays tech-free (entity + relationship names only, no class/table identifiers in prose).
- Write to `docs/specs/{Bucket}/{Bucket}.erd.md` with the DERIVED banner. **Do NOT** name it `01-domain-erd.md` (retired).

### 2c. Reimplementation Guide (on explicit request only)

A build-order narrative: capability dependency order, integration touchpoints, suggested rebuild sequence.

- This is the **only** derived artifact permitted to name a target stack (rebuild-guide exception, `spec-principles.md` §3).
- Write to `docs/specs/{Bucket}/{Bucket}.reimplementation-guide.md` with the DERIVED banner. **Do NOT** name it `06-reimplementation-guide.md` (retired).

---

## Step 3 — Stamp & Write

- Every generated file opens with the `> DERIVED — regenerate via /spec-index; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date.
- Write each file immediately after assembling it; do NOT accumulate large outputs in context.

---

## Step 4 — Verify (self-check before completing)

- [ ] **No retired artifacts emitted** — grep your own output paths: zero `M[0-9]`, zero `A-domain-model`/`B-business-rules`/`C-api-contracts`/`D-events`/`E-user-journeys`, zero `00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide`, zero `docs/specs/README.md`/`PRIORITY-INDEX.md`.
- [ ] **Every catalog row links to an existing Feature Spec** (no dangling links).
- [ ] **DERIVED banner present** on each generated file.
- [ ] **§1-7-derived prose is tech-free** (INDEX/ERD); only the reimplementation guide may name a stack.
- [ ] **No canonical claims** — the derived files never assert they are the source of truth.

---

## Hard Prohibitions (R1 mitigation — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This skill produces only the DERIVED index / ERD / reimplementation guide. Emitting an A-E engineering tree would create a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec. Therefore this skill MUST NEVER create:

| Forbidden output                                                                                          | Why                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `M##` directories (e.g., `M01/`, `M02/`)                                                                  | Retired per-module partition                                       |
| `A-domain-model.md` / `B-business-rules.md` / `C-api-contracts.md` / `D-events.md` / `E-user-journeys.md` | Retired A-E engineering bundle — content lives in the Feature Spec |
| `00-module-registry.md`                                                                                   | Retired registry — bucket `INDEX.md` is the catalog                |
| `01-domain-erd.md`                                                                                        | Retired per-system ERD name — use `{Bucket}.erd.md`                |
| `06-reimplementation-guide.md`                                                                            | Retired per-system name — use `{Bucket}.reimplementation-guide.md` |
| `docs/specs/README.md`, `docs/specs/PRIORITY-INDEX.md`                                                    | Retired QA dashboards — Section 8 is the canonical TC registry     |
| `docs/business-features/**`                                                                               | Not a spec home — all specs live under `docs/specs/`               |

If a user explicitly asks for an A-E bundle, explain it is retired and offer the derived index/ERD instead. The thin-index-only contract applies — output is DERIVED, never an A-E bundle.

## Selective Artifact Mode

| User goal                              | Generate                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Refresh the bucket index"             | `INDEX.md` only                                     |
| "I need the data model across the app" | Cross-capability ERD (`{Bucket}.erd.md`)            |
| "Produce a rebuild guide"              | Reimplementation guide (stack-neutral unless named) |
| "Full navigation set"                  | `INDEX.md` + ERD + reimplementation guide           |

---

## Next Steps

**[BLOCKING]** After completing, use `AskUserQuestion` — DO NOT skip:

- **"/docs-update (Recommended)"** — sync the Feature Specs + Section 8 if any source content was found stale during indexing
- **"/watzup"** — wrap up if index generation is the final step
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## What Is Spec Discovery? (v4.0.0)

A **derived-index generator** over the single-home spec tree. The canonical knowledge is the tech-free 8-section Feature Spec; this skill assembles regenerable navigation aids (catalog, cross-capability ERD, rebuild guide) so readers can browse a bucket or plan a replatform without a second hand-maintained layer. It does NOT reverse-engineer code into a parallel spec bundle — that role was retired with the A-E tree.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Give readers a regenerable, single-writer navigation layer (catalog + cross-capability ERD + rebuild guide) over the canonical Feature Specs — so a bucket can be browsed or replatformed without ever forking a second, hand-maintained source of truth
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Output is DERIVED — never emit `M##`/A-E/`00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide`/QA-dashboard files (see Hard Prohibitions). The thin-index-only contract applies.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** The Feature Spec (`docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md`) is the source of truth — this skill assembles, never authors, business content.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Confirm bucket + mode + artifacts via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE Step 1 — NEVER auto-start.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Context compaction/session resume → `TaskList` FIRST; never re-run a completed generation pass.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Stamp the DERIVED banner + regenerate date on every generated file; write after each artifact, never accumulate.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** INDEX/ERD prose tech-agnostic; only a reimplementation guide may name a target stack (rebuild-guide exception).
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** Every catalog row / ERD entity links to an existing Feature Spec; mark `[UNVERIFIED]` rather than guessing.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                               | Rebuttal                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "User wants full detail — regenerate the A-E bundle"  | A-E is not part of the spec model. Offer the derived index/ERD; the detail already lives in the Feature Spec + code. |
| "I'll write the ERD as `01-domain-erd.md`"            | Wrong filename. Use `{Bucket}.erd.md` with the DERIVED banner.                                                       |
| "The index can be the source of truth, it's complete" | NEVER — it is derived/regenerable. §1-7 + §8 of the Feature Spec are canonical.                                      |
| "No specs in this bucket, I'll extract from code"     | STOP. Route to `/spec`. This skill indexes existing specs; it does not author new ones.                              |
| "Scope is obvious, skip Step 0 AskUserQuestion"       | BLOCKING — NEVER auto-start. Bucket, mode, and artifact set MUST be confirmed first.                                 |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** MUST ATTENTION analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks/sub-tasks via TaskCreate before acting.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Break into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is critical.
