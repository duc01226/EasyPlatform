> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Validate a PBI artifact against the Definition of Ready (DoR) checklist. Block PBIs that fail required criteria from entering grooming.

**Key distinction:** Automated quality gate (not collaborative review — use `/pbi-challenge` for that).

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Workflow

1. **Locate PBI** — Find PBI artifact in `team-artifacts/pbis/` or active plan context. If not found, ask user for path.
2. **Load DoR protocol** — Apply DoR 7-criteria checklist (story template, testable AC, wireframes, UI design, AI pre-review, story points, dependencies)
3. **Evaluate each criterion** — Parse PBI sections against 7 DoR items:
    - Check user story template format ("As a... I want... So that...")
    - Scan AC for vague language ("should", "might", "TBD", "etc.", "various")
    - Verify GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format (min 3 scenarios)
    - Check for wireframe/mockup references (or explicit "N/A" for backend-only)
    - Check for UI design status
    - Verify story_points and complexity fields present with valid values
    - Verify dependencies table with correct columns
4. **Classify result:**
    - **PASS** — All 7 criteria pass → ready for grooming
    - **FAIL** — Any criterion fails → blocked, list fixes needed
5. **Output verdict** — Use the DoR Gate Output Template from protocol

## Checklist (from protocol)

### Required (ALL must pass)

- [ ] **User story template** — "As a {role}, I want {goal}, so that {benefit}" present
- [ ] **AC testable** — All AC use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN, no vague language, min 3 scenarios
- [ ] **Wireframes/mockups** — Present or explicit "N/A" for backend-only
- [ ] **UI design ready** — Completed or "N/A" for backend-only
- [ ] **AI pre-review** — `/refine-review` or `/pbi-challenge` result is PASS or WARN
- [ ] **Story points** — Valid Fibonacci (1-21) + complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] **Dependencies table** — Complete with Type column (must-before/can-parallel/blocked-by/independent)

## Output

```markdown
## DoR Gate Result

**PBI:** {PBI filename}
**Status:** PASS | FAIL
**Date:** {date}

### Checklist Results

| #   | Criterion                   | Status    | Evidence / Issue |
| --- | --------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | User story template         | ✅/❌     | {evidence}       |
| 2   | AC testable and unambiguous | ✅/❌     | {evidence}       |
| 3   | Wireframes/mockups          | ✅/❌/N/A | {evidence}       |
| 4   | UI design ready             | ✅/❌/N/A | {evidence}       |
| 5   | AI pre-review passed        | ✅/❌     | {evidence}       |
| 6   | Story points estimated      | ✅/❌     | {evidence}       |
| 7   | Dependencies complete       | ✅/❌     | {evidence}       |

### Blocking Items (if FAIL)

1. {Fix instruction}

### Verdict

**{READY_FOR_GROOMING | FIX_REQUIRED}**
```

## Key Rules

- **FAIL blocks grooming** — If ANY required criterion fails, PBI cannot enter grooming. List specific fixes.
- **No guessing** — Every check must reference specific content (line numbers) in the PBI artifact.
- **Protocol is source of truth** — Always reference `refinement-dor-checklist-protocol.md` for criteria definitions.
- **Story points >13** — Flag recommendation to split (not a FAIL, but a strong WARN).

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/handoff (Recommended)"** — If PASS: hand off to grooming presentation
- **"/refine"** — If FAIL: revise PBI
- **"/pbi-challenge"** — If collaborative review needed before re-checking DoR
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
