> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

- `docs/specs/` — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs; generate/update test specs via `/tdd-spec` after implementation)

<!-- SYNC:plan-quality -->

> **Plan Quality** — Every plan phase MUST ATTENTION include test specifications.

> 1. Add `## Test Specifications` section with TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} IDs to every phase file
> 2. Map every functional requirement to ≥1 TC (or explicit `TBD` with rationale)
> 3. TC IDs follow `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format — reference by ID, never embed full content
> 4. Before any new workflow step: call `TaskList` and re-read the phase file
> 5. On context compaction: call `TaskList` FIRST — never create duplicate tasks
> 6. Verify TC satisfaction per phase before marking complete (evidence must be `file:line`, not TBD)
>
> **Mode:** TDD-first → reference existing TCs with `Evidence: TBD`. Implement-first → use TBD → `/tdd-spec` fills after.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Plan parallel-executable phases and dispatch to fullstack-developer subagents for concurrent implementation.

**Workflow:**

1. **Plan** — Create plan with parallel-executable phases (strict file ownership)
2. **Dispatch** — Launch fullstack-developer subagents per phase
3. **Merge** — Integrate results and verify

**Key Rules:**

- Each subagent owns specific files; no cross-boundary edits
- Autonomous mode: no user confirmation between phases
- Break work into todo tasks; add final self-review task

**Ultrathink parallel** to implement: <tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**IMPORTANT:** Activate needed skills. Ensure token efficiency. Sacrifice grammar for concision.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Workflow

### 1. Research (Optional)

- Use max 2 `researcher` agents in parallel if tasks complex
- Use `/scout-ext` to search codebase
- Keep reports ≤150 lines
- **External Memory**: Write research to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read before parallel execution.

### 2. Parallel Planning

- Trigger `/plan-parallel <detailed-instruction>`
- Wait for plan with dependency graph, execution strategy, file ownership matrix

### 3. Parallel Implementation

- Read `plan.md` for dependency graph
- Launch multiple `fullstack-developer` agents in PARALLEL for concurrent phases
    - Example: "Phases 1-3 parallel" → launch 3 agents simultaneously
    - Pass phase file path: `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-*.md`
    - Include environment info
- Wait for all parallel phases complete before dependent phases
- Sequential phases: launch one agent at a time

### 4. Testing

- Use `tester` subagent for full test suite
- NO fake data/mocks/cheats
- If fail: use `debugger`, fix, repeat

### 5. Code Review

- Use `code-reviewer` for all changes
- If critical issues: fix, retest

### 6. Project Management & Docs

- If approved: use `project-manager` + `docs-manager` in parallel
- Update plan files, docs, roadmap
- If rejected: fix and repeat

### 7. Final Report

- Summary of all parallel phases
- Guide to get started
- Ask to commit (use `git-manager` if yes)

**Example:** Phases 1-3 parallel → Launch 3 fullstack-developer agents → Wait → Phase 4 sequential

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (feature implemented). This ensures review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/code-simplifier"** — Simplify and clean up implementation
- **"/workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide
  <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
    <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:plan-quality:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include `## Test Specifications` with TC IDs per phase. Call `TaskList` before creating new tasks.
    <!-- /SYNC:plan-quality:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:rationalization-prevention:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow ALL steps regardless of perceived simplicity. "Too simple to plan" is an evasion, not a reason.
    <!-- /SYNC:rationalization-prevention:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:red-flag-stop-conditions:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts. Report all attempts, ask user before continuing.
  <!-- /SYNC:red-flag-stop-conditions:reminder -->
  <!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.
    <!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
