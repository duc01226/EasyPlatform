## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Merge code from one branch to another with safety checks and conflict resolution.

**Workflow:**

1. **Validate** -- Check source/target branches, verify clean working tree
2. **Merge** -- Execute git merge with appropriate strategy
3. **Resolve** -- Handle conflicts if any, verify merge result

**Key Rules:**

- WARNING: destructive operation -- always confirm with user first
- Verify clean working tree before merge
- Use `/git-conflict-resolve` if conflicts arise

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Variables

TO_BRANCH: $1 (defaults to `main`)
FROM_BRANCH: $2 (defaults to current branch)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Sync with remote (CRITICAL)

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout {TO_BRANCH}
git pull origin {TO_BRANCH}
```

### Step 2: Merge from REMOTE tracking branch

```bash
# Use origin/{FROM_BRANCH} to merge remote state, not local WIP
git merge origin/{FROM_BRANCH} --no-ff -m "merge: {FROM_BRANCH} into {TO_BRANCH}"
```

**Why `origin/{FROM_BRANCH}`:** Ensures merging only committed+pushed changes, not local uncommitted work.

### Step 3: Resolve conflicts if any

- If conflicts exist, resolve them manually
- After resolution: `git add . && git commit`

### Step 4: Push merged result

```bash
git push origin {TO_BRANCH}
```

## Notes

- If `gh` command is not available, instruct the user to install and authorize GitHub CLI first.
- If you need more clarifications, use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask the user for more details.
- Always fetch and pull latest remote state before merging to avoid stale conflicts.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act, never guess.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
