>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output baseline findings.
>
> **Round 2:** MANDATORY fresh sub-agent review — see `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. The sub-agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with ZERO Round 1 memory. It must catch:

> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the main session rationalized away
>
> **Round 3+ (recursive after fixes):** After ANY fix cycle, MANDATORY fresh sub-agent re-review. Spawn a **NEW** Agent tool call each iteration — never reuse Round 2's agent. Each new agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with full protocol injection. Continue until PASS or **3 fresh-subagent rounds max**, then escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion`.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER declare PASS after Round 1 alone
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW Agent call
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — if still FAIL, escalate via `AskUserQuestion` (do NOT silently loop)
> - Track round count in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds

> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2.**

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Sub-Agent Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias via isolated sub-agents.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/cook`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** Round 2 of ANY review AND every recursive re-review iteration after fixes. NOT needed when Round 1 already PASSes with zero issues.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Spawn a NEW `Agent` tool call — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - NEVER skip fresh-subagent review because "last round was clean" — every fix triggers a fresh round
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — escalate via `AskUserQuestion` if still failing; do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol
> - Track iteration count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

<!-- /SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

<!-- SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 10 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 10 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 10 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: JS: === vs ==, typeof null. C#: async void, missing using, LINQ deferred execution.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. From changed files → find TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} in docs/business-features/{Service}/detailed-features/{Feature}.md Section 15.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding TC (or flag as "needs TC").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Verify TC evidence fields point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
5. Auth changes → TC-{FEAT}-02x exist? Data changes → TC-{FEAT}-01x exist?
6. If no specs exist → log gap and recommend /tdd-spec.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 10 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- /SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Critical Purpose:** Ensure quality — no flaws, no bugs, no missing updates, no stale content. Verify code AND documentation.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write intermediate findings + final results to `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss, serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% verify first).

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Assess production readiness of service-layer and API changes — score observability, reliability, data integrity, and database performance.

**When to use:** After implementing backend service or API changes, before committing. Frontend-only changes exempt.

**Why:** Working code that can't be debugged, monitored, or rolled back is technical debt in disguise.

**Deployment context:** Read `docs/project-config.json` → `infrastructure` section:

- `containerization` → check Dockerfiles, docker-compose
- `orchestration` → check K8s manifests, Helm charts
- `cicd.tool` → check pipeline configs

## Your Mission

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.**

- NEVER accept operational readiness at face value — verify by reading actual implementations
- Every score MUST have `file:line` evidence — unprovable score = 0
- Question: "Is this really handled?" → trace error/retry/timeout path to confirm
- Challenge: "Are ALL failure modes covered?" → check what happens when dependencies fail
- Verify: "Can we debug this in production?" → check logging, correlation, metrics

## Scope Resolution

1. Arguments specify files/directories → review those
2. Else → review uncommitted changes (`git diff --name-only`)
3. Focus: `*.cs` in `src/Services/`, API controllers, service classes
4. Skip: frontend files, test files, documentation, config-only changes

## Production Readiness Scoring

Score each criterion 0-2: **0** = not addressed, **1** = partially, **2** = fully.

### Observability (max 8)

> **Think:** If this service errors at 3am, can on-call engineer diagnose root cause from logs alone — without reproducing?

| #   | Criterion              | What to Check                                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Structured Logging** | External API calls and critical operations log errors with context (request ID, user, parameters)             |
| 2   | **Error Context**      | Exceptions include enough context to diagnose without reproducing (entity IDs, operation type, input summary) |
| 3   | **Metrics Awareness**  | Operations >100ms consider tracking duration. New endpoints consider latency monitoring                       |
| 4   | **Correlation**        | Cross-service calls include or propagate correlation IDs for distributed tracing                              |

### Reliability (max 8)

> **Think:** If the downstream dependency is down or slow, does this service degrade gracefully or cascade-fail?

| #   | Criterion                 | What to Check                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5   | **Retry Strategy**        | Transient failures (HTTP, DB timeouts) have retry logic or documented reason for not retrying             |
| 6   | **Timeout Configuration** | HTTP clients and external calls have explicit timeout (not relying on defaults)                           |
| 7   | **Error Handling**        | Errors handled gracefully — no swallowed exceptions, no generic catch-all without logging                 |
| 8   | **Fallback Behavior**     | Critical paths define behavior when dependencies fail (degraded mode, cached response, user-facing error) |

### Data Integrity (max 4)

> **Think:** If database wiped and reseeded from scratch, does system still reach a valid state?

| #   | Criterion              | What to Check                                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9   | **Seed vs Migration**  | Seed data (default records, system config) lives in startup data seeders, NOT in one-time migration executors |
| 10  | **Seeder Idempotency** | Data seeders use check-then-create pattern (query before insert) — safe for repeated runs on any environment  |

**Decision test:** _"If the database is reset, does this data still need to exist?"_ Yes → must be in seeder. No → migration acceptable.

### Database Performance (max 4)

> **Think:** At 10x current data volume, do these queries still complete in <1s?

> **[IMPORTANT] Database Performance Protocol (MANDATORY):**
>
> 1. **Paging Required** — ALL list/collection queries MUST ATTENTION use pagination. NEVER load all records into memory. Verify: no unbounded `GetAll()`, `ToList()`, or `Find()` without `Skip/Take` or cursor-based paging.
> 2. **Index Required** — ALL query filter fields, foreign keys, and sort columns MUST ATTENTION have database indexes configured. Verify: entity expressions match index field order, database collections have index management methods, migrations include indexes for WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY columns.

| #   | Criterion            | What to Check                                                                                                          |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | **Pagination**       | List/collection queries use pagination (Skip/Take, cursor). No unbounded GetAll/ToList loading all records into memory |
| 12  | **Database Indexes** | Query filter fields, foreign keys, and sort columns have matching database indexes. Migrations include index creation  |

## Structural Impact Analysis (RECOMMENDED if graph.db exists)

- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph graph-blast-radius --json` → blast radius >20 nodes = high-risk deployment
- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query tests_for <function_name> --json` → verify test coverage on changed functions
- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <service-file> --direction downstream --json` → verify all downstream event handlers, bus consumers, cross-service calls have error handling

## Round 2: Fresh Sub-Agent Review (MANDATORY)

NEVER declare PASS after Round 1 alone. Round 2 MUST spawn a fresh sub-agent with ZERO Round 1 memory — NEVER re-review in the same session.

**Spawn via canonical template in `SYNC:review-protocol-injection`:**

1. `subagent_type`: `code-reviewer`
2. Task: `"SRE production readiness review — score all 12 criteria (0-2) for {files reviewed in Round 1}"`
3. Round: `"Round 2. Zero memory of prior rounds. Re-read ALL target files from scratch."`
4. Reference Docs: `docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md`
5. Target Files: same files from Scope Resolution
6. Integrate sub-agent report findings — DO NOT filter or override

**Round 2 focus** (what Round 1 typically misses):

- Operational concerns spanning multiple services
- Subtle reliability gaps (retry, circuit breakers, timeout handling)
- Missing observability (structured logging, correlation IDs, metrics)
- Data integrity edge cases under concurrent load

**Final verdict = Round 1 + Round 2 combined.**

{Proceed / Address gaps first}
```

## Important Notes

- Advisory (final VERDICT only) — score/verdict inform team but don't block commits; MANDATORY process steps (graph gate, Round 2, Database Performance Protocol) are NEVER advisory
- Evidence-based — cite `file:line` for every score; unprovable score = 0
- Proportional — small bug fixes need less rigor than new endpoints (applies to VERDICT interpretation, NOT to skipping MANDATORY steps)
- Check framework patterns — background job base handlers, base controller error handling

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If NOT already in workflow, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask user:
>
> 1. **Activate `feature` workflow** (Recommended) — scout → investigate → plan → cook → review → sre-review → test → docs
> 2. **Execute `/sre-review` directly** — run standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** — after completing, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion`:

- **"/watzup (Recommended)"** — wrap up + check doc staleness
- **"/test"** — run tests before wrapping up
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend.

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute TWO review rounds. Round 2 delegates to fresh code-reviewer sub-agent (zero prior context) — never skip or combine with Round 1.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks via `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER declare PASS after Round 1 alone — Round 2 MUST spawn fresh sub-agent with zero prior context
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every score requires `file:line` evidence — unprovable score = 0
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ALL list queries MUST use pagination; ALL filter fields MUST have indexes
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding (when graph.db exists)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide

| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Round 1 was thorough, skip Round 2"          | NEVER — fresh sub-agent catches what you rationalized away                   |
| "Small change, skip graph gate"               | HARD-GATE applies regardless of size — run one command                       |
| "No explicit paging but it looks fine"        | Score 0 until proven with `file:line`. Assume worst without evidence         |
| "Already checked observability"               | Show `file:line` proof. No proof = no check                                  |
| "VERDICT is advisory so skip MANDATORY steps" | Advisory = VERDICT only. Graph gate, Round 2, DB Protocol are NEVER advisory |
