description: '[Code Quality] Validate design rationale completeness in plan files before implementation'

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before executing.

> **Critical Purpose:** Ensure quality — no flaws, no bugs, no missing updates, no stale content. Verify both code AND documentation.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Validate that a plan contains sufficient design rationale (WHY, not just WHAT) before implementation begins.

**Applies to:** Features and refactors only — bugfixes and trivial changes exempt.

**Why this exists:** AI code generation optimizes mechanics but misses conceptual quality. This skill ensures the human thinking happened before the mechanical coding starts.

## Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking. Every claim needs traced proof.**

- Do NOT accept plan rationale at face value — verify alternatives were genuinely considered
- Every pass/fail must include evidence (section reference, specific text quoted)
- If rationale is vague or hand-wavy, flag it — "we chose X" without WHY is a fail
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the best approach?" → check if alternatives have real trade-offs listed
- Challenge completeness: "Are all risks identified?" → think about what could go wrong that isn't mentioned
- No "looks fine" without proof — state what you verified and how

## Plan Resolution

1. If arguments contain a path → use that plan directory
2. Else check `## Plan Context` in injected context → use active plan path
3. If no plan found → tell user: "No active plan found. Run `/plan` or `/plan-hard` first."

## Validation Checklist

Read the plan's `plan.md` and all `phase-*.md` files. Check each item below. Report pass/fail for each.

### Required Sections (in plan.md or phase files)

| #   | Section                     | What to Check                                  | Pass Criteria                                     |
| --- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Problem Statement**       | Clearly states WHAT problem is being solved    | 2-3 sentences describing the problem              |
| 2   | **Alternatives Considered** | 2+ approaches with pros/cons                   | Minimum 2 alternatives with trade-offs            |
| 3   | **Design Rationale**        | Explains WHY chosen approach over alternatives | Explicit reasoning linking decision to trade-offs |
| 4   | **Risk Assessment**         | Risks identified with likelihood and impact    | At least 1 risk per phase                         |
| 5   | **Ownership**               | Clear who maintains code post-merge            | Implicit OK (author owns), explicit better        |

### Optional (Flag if Missing, Don't Fail)

| #   | Section                  | When Required                           |
| --- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 6   | **Operational Impact**   | Service-layer or API changes            |
| 7   | **Cross-Service Impact** | Changes touching multiple microservices |
| 8   | **Migration Strategy**   | Database schema or data changes         |

## Output Format

## Why-Review Results

**Plan:** {plan path}
**Date:** {date}
**Verdict:** PASS / NEEDS WORK

### Checklist

| #   | Check                   | Status | Notes     |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| 1   | Problem Statement       | ✅/❌  | {details} |
| 2   | Alternatives Considered | ✅/❌  | {details} |
| 3   | Design Rationale        | ✅/❌  | {details} |
| 4   | Risk Assessment         | ✅/❌  | {details} |
| 5   | Ownership               | ✅/❌  | {details} |

### Missing Items (if any)

- {specific item to add before implementation}

### Recommendation

{Proceed to /cook | Add missing sections first}
```

## Scope

- **Applies to:** Features, refactors, architectural changes
- **Exempt:** Bugfixes, config changes, single-file tweaks, documentation-only
- **Enforcement:** Advisory (soft warning) — does not block implementation

## Important Notes

- Review only — do NOT modify plan files or implement changes
- Keep output concise — actionable in <2 minutes
- If plan is simple and clear, a short "PASS" is sufficient
