> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Enforce quality gates, verify compliance with standards, and track quality metrics across the development lifecycle.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify Gate** — Determine which quality gate applies (Idea>PBI, PBI>Dev, Dev>QA, QA>Release)
2. **Verify Checklist** — Run through pass/fail criteria for the gate stage
3. **Generate Report** — Produce PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL gate status with evidence
4. **Track Metrics** — Log in audit trail and update quality metrics dashboard

**Key Rules:**

- Every gate must have a clear PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL status
- Evidence must be provided for critical checklist items
- Sign-offs are required before release gates can pass

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Quality Gates

Define pass/fail criteria at each stage:

#### Gate: Idea → PBI

- [ ] Problem statement present
- [ ] Business value articulated
- [ ] No technical solution prescribed
- [ ] Target users identified

#### Gate: PBI → Development

- [ ] Acceptance criteria in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
- [ ] Out of scope defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Design approved (if applicable)

#### Gate: Development → QA

- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Unit tests >80% coverage
- [ ] No P1/P2 linting errors
- [ ] Documentation updated

#### Gate: QA → Release

- [ ] All test cases executed
- [ ] No open P1/P2 bugs
- [ ] Regression suite passed
- [ ] PO sign-off received

### 2. Compliance Verification

- Code follows architecture patterns
- Security requirements met
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Audit Trail

Track artifact lifecycle:

```
{Artifact} | {Action} | {By} | {Date} | {Notes}
```

### 4. Quality Metrics

#### Code Quality

- Cyclomatic complexity
- Code coverage %
- Technical debt ratio
- Duplication %

#### Process Quality

- Defect escape rate
- First-time-right %
- Cycle time
- Lead time

## Workflow Integration

### Running Quality Gate

When user runs `/quality-gate {artifact-or-pr}`:

1. Identify gate type based on artifact/stage
2. Load appropriate checklist
3. Verify each criterion
4. Generate pass/fail report
5. Log in audit trail

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
