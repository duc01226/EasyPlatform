## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Fix TypeScript compilation errors and type mismatches across the codebase.

**Workflow:**

1. **Collect** — Run `tsc --noEmit` or `nx build` to gather type errors
2. **Analyze** — Classify errors (missing types, wrong signatures, import issues)
3. **Fix** — Apply type-safe fixes without `any` casts where possible

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Prefer proper typing over `any` or type assertions
- Fix root cause (wrong interface, missing export) not symptoms

> **[MANDATORY]** Read `.claude/skills/shared/root-cause-debugging-protocol.md` BEFORE proposing any fix. Responsibility attribution and data lifecycle tracing are required.

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After identifying type errors and root cause, MUST present findings + proposed fix to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

Run `bun run typecheck` or `tsc` or `npx tsc` and fix all type errors.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

## Rules

- Fix all of type errors and repeat the process until there are no more type errors.
- Do not use `any` just to pass the type check.

- **After fixing, MUST run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MUST** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MUST** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MUST** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** READ the following files before starting:
- **MUST** READ `.claude/skills/shared/understand-code-first-protocol.md` before starting
- **MUST** READ `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before starting
