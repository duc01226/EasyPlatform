Run `bun run typecheck` or `tsc` or `npx tsc` and fix all type errors.

## Rules
- Fix all of type errors and repeat the process until there are no more type errors.
- Do not use `any` just to pass the type check.

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
