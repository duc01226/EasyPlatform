# Archived Skills

Skills moved here are not active but preserved for reference.

## frontend-development

**Archived:** 2026-01-13
**Reason:** React/TypeScript skill in Angular 19 project

This skill teaches React patterns (hooks, Suspense, TanStack Router) which conflicts with EasyPlatform's Angular stack. Use `frontend-angular-*` skills instead.

### Active Angular Skills
- `frontend-angular-component` - Component patterns
- `frontend-angular-form` - Form handling
- `frontend-angular-store` - State management
- `frontend-angular-api-service` - API services

## bug-diagnosis

**Archived:** 2026-01-13
**Reason:** Merged into `debugging` skill

EasyPlatform-specific debugging content was extracted and moved to `debugging/references/easyplatform-debugging.md`. The generic debugging framework in `debugging/` now includes platform-specific references.

### Use Instead
- `debugging` - Comprehensive debugging framework with EasyPlatform-specific reference
