> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST READ** before executing:

- `.claude/skills/shared/web-research-protocol.md`

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Build structured course material with learning objectives, modules, lessons, exercises, and assessments.

**Workflow:**

1. **Define scope** — Target audience, prerequisites, duration, objectives
2. **Map objectives** — Align to Bloom's taxonomy
3. **Structure curriculum** — Modules → Lessons → Exercises → Assessments
4. **Develop content** — Per lesson: concept, explanation, examples, exercises
5. **Create assessments** — Knowledge checks + final assessment
6. **Review pedagogy** — Progressive difficulty, prerequisite chains

**Key Rules:**

- Every objective mapped to Bloom's taxonomy level
- Progressive complexity (each module builds on previous)
- Use enforced template from `docs/templates/course-outline-template.md`

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Course Builder

## Bloom's Taxonomy Reference

| Level          | Verb Examples                             | Assessment Type                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Remember**   | Define, list, recall, identify            | Multiple choice, fill-in-blank      |
| **Understand** | Explain, describe, summarize, interpret   | Short answer, paraphrase            |
| **Apply**      | Use, implement, solve, demonstrate        | Problem sets, exercises             |
| **Analyze**    | Compare, contrast, examine, differentiate | Case studies, analysis papers       |
| **Evaluate**   | Judge, critique, assess, justify          | Debates, reviews, peer assessment   |
| **Create**     | Design, construct, produce, develop       | Projects, portfolios, presentations |

## Step 1: Define Learning Scope

Gather from user or research:

- **Target audience** — Who? What's their background?
- **Prerequisites** — What must they know already?
- **Duration** — Total hours/weeks available
- **Desired outcomes** — What can they DO after the course?

## Step 2: Map Objectives to Bloom's

For each desired outcome, assign a Bloom's level:

- Start with lower levels (Remember, Understand)
- Progress to higher levels (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- Ensure at least one objective at Apply level or above

## Step 3: Structure Curriculum

Organize into modules (3-8 per course):

- Each module has 2-5 lessons
- Each module has its own learning objectives
- Modules build on each other (prerequisite chain)

## Step 4: Develop Lesson Content

For each lesson, provide:

1. **Duration** — Estimated time
2. **Concept** — Core idea in 1-2 sentences
3. **Explanation** — Theory, context, why it matters
4. **Examples** — 2-3 real-world illustrations
5. **Exercise** — Hands-on practice activity
6. **Assessment** — How to verify learning

## Step 5: Create Assessments

Per module:

- **Knowledge check** — 3-5 questions covering key concepts
- Questions aligned to module's Bloom's level

Final:

- **Comprehensive assessment** — Covers all modules
- **Mix of Bloom's levels** — At least 1 question per level taught

## Output

Write to `docs/knowledge/courses/{descriptive-slug}.md` using enforced template from `docs/templates/course-outline-template.md`.

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
