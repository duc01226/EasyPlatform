# SYNC Inline Versions — Checklist Format (5-15 lines each)

> This file contains the canonical checklist versions of shared protocols.
> These are what gets copied into `<!-- SYNC:tag -->` blocks across all skills.
> To update: edit here first, then `grep SYNC:tag-name` and update all copies.
>
> **Tier contract.** `## SYNC:<tag>` = the CONDENSED checklist embedded as `<!-- SYNC:tag -->` in skill `SKILL.md` files. `## SYNC:<tag>:full` = the FULL variant and the **single build source** for the always-on static-context bakes (root `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Codex) — read via `.claude/scripts/lib/extract-sync-block.cjs` and composed by `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`. A `:full` body is PLAIN markdown so every static carrier can render it consistently. Edit BOTH tiers HERE first, then propagate.

## SYNC:understand-code-first

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone. — why: long context drifts from the file; the file is ground truth
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation. — why: divergent patterns fragment the codebase and slow every future reader
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence

## SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line`, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
> 2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
> 3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Evidence file path (`file:line`) `- [ ]` Grep search performed `- [ ]` 3+ similar patterns found `- [ ]` Confidence level stated
>
> **Forbidden without proof:** "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because"
> **If incomplete →** output: `"Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."`

## SYNC:estimation-framework

> **Estimation Framework** — Bottom-up first; SP DERIVED; output min-max range when likely ≥3d. Stack-agnostic. Baseline: 3-5yr dev, 6 productive hrs/day. AI estimate assumes Claude Code + project context.
>
> **Method:**
>
> 1. **Blast Radius pass** (below) — drives code AND test cost
> 2. Decompose phases → hours/phase → `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours`
> 3. `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6) × productivity_factor`
> 4. Sum **Risk Margin** (base + add-ons) → `max_days = likely_days × (1 + margin)`
> 5. `min_days = likely_days × 0.9`
> 6. Output as range when `likely_days ≥3`; single point allowed `<3` (still record margin)
> 7. `man_days_ai` = same range × AI speedup
> 8. `story_points` DERIVED from `likely_days` via SP-Days — NEVER driver. Disagreement >50% → trust bottom-up
>
> **Productivity factor:** 0.8 strong scaffolding+codegen+AI hooks · 1.0 mature default · 1.2 weak patterns · 1.5 greenfield
>
> **Cost Driver Heuristic (apply BEFORE work-type row):**
>
> - **UI dominates** in CRUD/business apps — 1.5-3x backend (states, validation, responsive, a11y, polish)
> - **Backend dominates ONLY:** multi-aggregate invariants, cross-service contracts, schema migrations, heavy query/perf, new event flows
>

## SYNC:ui-system-context

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

## SYNC:existing-ui-research

> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:
>
> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult design-system docs + the real component inventory).
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer existing components, patterns, and layout conventions; justify any new component against what already exists.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that explicitly.

## SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles

> **UI/UX Design Principles (Rev 1.0 — 40 clauses, web + mobile)** — the working rule set for ANY task that designs, plans, implements, or reviews a user interface. Applies to BOTH platforms unless a clause names one (§8 is mobile/touch). Cite clauses by ID: `UI-3.1`, `UI-8.2`.
>
> **Precedence:** project design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs OUTRANK these clauses; these clauses outrank generic taste. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides — NEVER resolved silently. — why: the project's own recorded decision is the authority; these clauses are the default when it is silent.
>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.
>
> **Apply by role** — the clauses are one set; what you DO with them depends on the task:
>
> | Role                                | Obligation                                                                                                                                                              |
> | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | DESIGN / PLAN a surface             | Clauses shape the artifact: empty/loading/error specified first (`UI-1.5`), all 5 states enumerated (`UI-5.2`), type scale + spacing unit declared (`UI-2.5`, `UI-4.1`) |
> | IMPLEMENT a component               | Pre-completion gate: states · tokens · contrast · focus ring · touch target · reserved space (`UI-5.2`, `UI-2.5`/`UI-4.1`, `UI-3.1`, `UI-5.5`, `UI-8.1`, `UI-9.3`)      |
> | REVIEW UI code or a design artifact | Each clause is a fail-condition; every finding cites `UI-<clause>` + `file:line` + severity. NEVER a tick-box sweep — one focused pass per section                      |
> | SCAN / document a UI system         | Record where the PROJECT deliberately deviates, so the overriding doc becomes the recorded authority                                                                    |

## SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles:reminder

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`) to any user-facing surface: one focal point, proximity grouping, empty/loading/error designed FIRST (§1) · ≤2 families, 16px web / 17px mobile body, never <14px, 45–75ch, fixed 6-step scale (§2) · 4.5:1 text / 3:1 edges measured, one accent, colour never alone, dark mode ≠ inversion (§3) · one 4/8px unit, `gap` over margins, tighter-inside-looser-between, content-driven breakpoints (§4) · <100ms response, all 5 states, undo over confirm, 150–250ms ease-out honouring reduced-motion, visible focus ring (§5) · where-am-I/what's-here/where-next, ≤5 top-level destinations, user's words, URL or back path (§6) · fewer fields, visible labels, validate on blur, matched keyboard, NEVER lose input (§7) · ≥44×44pt targets 8px apart, bottom-third primaries, gestures never the only route, safe areas (§8) · structure before data, optimistic update with visible rollback, reserved space, slow-connection states (§9). Project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — a genuine conflict goes to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite every finding as `UI-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for changes with no user-facing surface, stated explicitly.

## SYNC:plan-quality

> **Plan Quality** — Every plan phase MUST ATTENTION include test specifications.
>
> 1. Add `## Test Specifications` section with TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs to every phase file
> 2. Map every functional requirement to ≥1 TC (or explicit `TBD` with rationale)
> 3. TC IDs follow `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format — reference by ID, never embed full content
> 4. Before any new workflow step: call `TaskList` and re-read the phase file
> 5. On context compaction: call `TaskList` FIRST — never create duplicate tasks
> 6. Verify TC satisfaction per phase before marking complete (evidence must be `file:line`, not TBD)
>
> **Mode:** TDD-first → reference existing TCs with `Evidence: TBD`. Implement-first → use TBD → `/spec [mode=tests]` fills after.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.

## SYNC:cross-stack-impact-trace

> **Cross-Stack Impact Trace** — FIRST review action: comprehend change holistically, THEN judge files. Every reviewed diff: note change context, trace full pipeline of main affected area end-to-end across client↔server seam, so a change on one tier can never silently break the other. (Distinct from `SYNC:cross-service-check`, which owns service-to-service / event boundary — this owns client↔server tier seam inside one app; pair both for full-pipeline coverage.)
>
> 1. **Comprehend context FIRST** — before file-by-file review, write short **Change Context** note: what changed, intent (why), originating tier (frontend / backend / shared / infra), main affected feature/flow. Do before flagging anything.
> 2. **Identify cross-stack seam(s)** — for main affected area, locate contract seam(s) between client and server: API route/endpoint + verb, request/response DTO or payload shape, shared type/schema, event/message contract, query/route params. Infer tier layout from `docs/project-config.json` and project conventions.
> 3. **Trace full pipeline end-to-end, in change's direction:**
>     - **Backend change → trace FORWARD to every frontend consumer:** handler/controller → response DTO/serializer → API client/service → store/state → component/template rendering or submitting it.
>     - **Frontend change → trace BACKWARD to backend contract:** component/form → API client call → route/endpoint → request DTO/validation → handler/domain.
>     - When `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, use `/graph-connect-api` and `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` to map connection; otherwise grep route path, DTO/type name, each field name across BOTH tiers.
> 4. **Verify BOTH sides still agree** — for every changed seam confirm other tier matches: route path & verb, field names & types, nullability/optionality, required vs optional params, enum values, auth/permission, error/status shape. Any mismatch = **BREAKING** finding (backend change breaks a frontend consumer, or frontend now sends what backend rejects).
> 5. **Classify each seam:** NONE (no contract change) / ADDITIVE (backward-compatible) / BREAKING (consumer on other tier must change too). BREAKING seam whose other-tier consumer NOT updated in same diff = HIGH severity minimum (CRITICAL for auth/money/data-integrity paths).
>
> **Skip ONLY** when change has no cross-tier seam — pure docs, pure styling with no data contract, or single-tier tooling. State explicitly: `Single-tier change — no cross-stack seam`. Backend-only or single-tier repo still traces internal consumers (`SYNC:cross-service-check` for service/event boundaries).
>
> **BLOCKED until:** Change Context noted · seam(s) identified or explicit N/A · full pipeline traced in change direction · every changed seam classified NONE / ADDITIVE / BREAKING.

> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.

## SYNC:double-round-trip-review

> **Validated-Finding Fix + Full Re-Review Loop** — Re-review is triggered by a validated finding fix cycle, not by a round number. Review purpose: `review → validate findings → fix validated findings → full re-review` until a complete review pass clears the round's exit bar (see **Severity floor** below). **A clean review ENDS the loop — no further rounds required.**
>
> _aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**._ The name is historical — there is **NO 2-round cap**; "double-round-trip" only means a validated-finding fix cycle forces at least one fresh re-review. It runs until a clean pass, bounded by the **3-round ceiling** below.
>
> **Round cap — 3 rounds MAX (a ceiling, NEVER a target).** A clean pass ENDS the loop immediately at ANY round — round 1 included; the cap never obliges you to keep spinning. Hitting round 3 with blocking findings still open (severity floor applied) → **STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`** with the still-open findings listed; NEVER emit a silent "good enough" PASS on cap exhaustion, and NEVER let the cap substitute for the clean-review requirement. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule stays an EARLIER exit — escalate at whichever trips first.
>
> **Severity floor — from round 3, LOW stops blocking.** The exit bar tightens by round, so the loop converges on consequence instead of spinning on polish:

> Define one predicate everywhere: `blocking_findings(round, findings)` returns all validated findings in rounds 1–2 and only validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings in round 3+. A binary gate (test-green, security must-fix, required artifact) is exempt only when its owning invariant explicitly says so.
>
> | Round | Exit bar — loop ENDS when the fresh full review has…                      | Must be fixed to continue      |
> | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | 1-2   | zero validated findings at ANY severity                                   | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM · LOW |
> | 3+    | zero validated CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM findings — **LOW-only is a PASS** | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM only  |
>
> From round 3 onward LOW findings are **NOT required to be fixed**: a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW **ENDS the loop immediately** — do not open another round for them. Severity tiers are `SYNC:severity-rubric` (CRITICAL block-merge · HIGH must-fix · MEDIUM should-fix · LOW nice-to-fix); rounds 1-2 are unchanged, so an easy LOW still gets fixed early when it is cheap.
>
> **Severity-floor rules:**
>
> - **Never silently drop a deferred LOW.** Every unfixed LOW is listed in the final report under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` with file, line, and description, so the owner can schedule it. Dropping it from the report is a protocol violation, not a clean pass.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to trigger the exit.** Downgrading a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW so the loop can end is a FALSE PASS. Severity is set by consequence per `SYNC:severity-rubric` before the round bar is applied — never after, and never with the exit in view. — why: a floor that can be reached by relabeling is not a floor.
> - **The floor bounds the loop, not the standard.** It ends _iteration_; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and it never lowers the finding-survival bar that admits a finding in the first place.
> - **The floor never applies to a hard gate.** Test-green gates (a suite must actually pass), security must-fix gates, and any gate whose criterion is binary rather than severity-rated are unaffected — a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding.
>
> **Universal scope (any new output/judgment):** any newly produced output or judgment gets **≥1 self-review**; any **new judgment** gets **≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass**; anything flagged to re-check is re-checked **≥1 time** — before that output is treated as final. This loop is the default convergence contract for ANY work-producing skill, not review skills only.
>
> **Routing invariant (author-facing):** a skill that validates findings MUST route them through `/why-review --validate-findings` (the terminal validator) — NEVER fork an inline finding-validation. Routing through why-review is what makes the finding-survival bar and this loop apply; the `verify-review-validate-coverage` sensor enforces this exact route mechanically.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output findings + verdict (PASS / FAIL).
>
> **Decision after Round 1:**
>
> - **No issues found (PASS, zero findings)** → review ENDS. Do NOT spawn a fresh sub-agent for confirmation.
> - **`blocking_findings(round, findings)` is non-empty** → run the active review skill's findings-validation gate first; for review skills the default gate is `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`. Fix only validated findings, then restart the full review protocol from the beginning with a fresh task breakdown.
>
> **Fresh full re-review after every fix cycle:** Re-run the whole review protocol over the current full target. When sub-agents are part of that protocol, spawn NEW `Agent` calls — never reuse prior agents. Reviewers re-read ALL files from scratch with ZERO memory of prior rounds. See `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. Each fresh full review must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in the prior round
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the prior round rationalized away
> - Regressions introduced by the fixes themselves
>
> **Loop termination:** After each full re-review, repeat the same decision against **that round's exit bar**: bar cleared → END; blocking findings remain → validate findings → fix → restart from the first review phase. Rounds 1-2 clear on zero findings at any severity; **from round 3 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop** (deferred LOWs go in the report). Capped at **3 rounds**. Escalate via `AskUserQuestion` at whichever comes first: the same validated finding repeats for 2 full invocations with no progress · a fix requires product/owner input · round 3 completes with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open. NEVER loop past 3 rounds, and NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - A clean Round 1 ENDS the review — no mandatory Round 2
> - From round 3 on, a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop — never open round N+1 to fix LOW alone; list those LOWs as deferred instead
> - NEVER re-tier a CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the round-3 exit — severity is assigned by consequence before the bar is applied
> - NEVER fix unvalidated findings; validate first using the caller's validation gate
> - Every surviving finding must additionally clear the **finding-survival bar** defined in why-review's Findings Validation Routine (a deliberately higher bar than the generic act-gate — "keep this finding?" is a stricter question than "act on this evidence?"); a finding below the bar is demoted or dropped, not kept
> - NEVER skip the full re-review after a fix cycle (every fix invalidates the prior verdict)
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration that uses sub-agents spawns NEW Agent calls
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - The 3-round cap NEVER replaces the clean-review requirement — it bounds runaway looping, it does not authorize shipping an un-clean review; a clean pass ends the loop early at any round, and cap exhaustion escalates rather than passes
> - Enforce the round cap of 3 alongside the 2 repeated-no-progress blocker rule; both are escalation triggers, neither is a completion criterion
> - Track recursive invocation count and repeated blockers in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds executed
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2 that was executed, plus `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` whenever the loop ended on the round-3+ bar with LOWs still open.**

## SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute the review loop (aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**): review → validate findings → fix validated findings → full re-review. A complete review pass with zero findings ENDS the review. Any newly produced output/judgment gets ≥1 self-review; any new judgment gets ≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass before it is treated as final.
- **MANDATORY** apply the **severity floor**: rounds 1-2 exit on zero findings at any severity; **from round 3 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM — LOW findings are no longer required to be fixed, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop.** List every deferred LOW in the report; NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the exit, and NEVER apply the floor to a binary gate (test-green, security must-fix).
- **MANDATORY** enforce the **round cap of 3 — a ceiling, NEVER a target**: a clean pass ends the loop immediately at any round (round 1 included), and round 3 completing with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open → **STOP & escalate via `AskUserQuestion`**, never a silent PASS. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule is an earlier exit — escalate at whichever trips first. NEVER loop open-ended.

Exclude migration files: schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
> 2. For each identified file → search for a corresponding test file. Infer test naming from existing tests in the project (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*Tests.java`, `*_test.py`, `*.spec.js`, `*Tests.cs`). Check standard test directories (`tests/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`, or adjacent test projects/packages).
> 3. If test EXISTS → check if test methods cover changed behavior (new methods/parameters/logic paths)
> 4. If test MISSING → **MANDATORY**: use `AskUserQuestion`: "Business logic file `{file}` has no integration tests — run `/integration-test` before proceeding, or confirm tests already written?" Options: "Run `/integration-test` first" (Recommended) | "Tests already written/updated — proceed"
> 5. Severity: **HIGH** — missing tests for changed business logic MUST be surfaced to the user; do NOT silently flag and continue

## SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate

> **Domain Entity Change Gate** — ONE protocol binding every skill or agent that PLANS, IMPLEMENTS, or REVIEWS a change touching a domain entity, value object, or aggregate, so a planner, an implementer, and a reviewer apply the SAME rules to the SAME change. `/domain-entities-review` is the canonical owner of the full A–P checklist; this gate is the shared trigger plus the decision set that must be answered. NEVER re-derive a weaker local copy — why: when planning and review disagree on entity rules, the plan ships a design that review then rejects, and the rework is paid twice.
>
> **Trigger — fires when ANY holds:** a new entity / value object / aggregate root is introduced · an existing one gains or loses a field, invariant, relationship, or state transition · an aggregate boundary, repository, or cross-aggregate reference changes · a domain event is added, renamed, or re-payloaded · a concurrency or reconstitution concern on a root changes. State `No domain-entity surface — gate N/A` when none holds.

## SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate:reminder

**MUST ATTENTION** when the change PLANS or REVIEWS a new/updated domain entity, value object, or aggregate, apply the **Domain Entity Change Gate** — `/domain-entities-review` owns the full A–P checklist; detect paradigm + subdomain fit FIRST, then answer all 6 decision points (classification · invariant ownership + failure signalling · aggregate boundary + concurrency · construction vs reconstitution · events · property-TC test obligation). Planning must NAME each decision; plan review treats an unanswered row as a FINDING; change review routes to the owner (Mode A read / Mode B delegate). SKIP under the 3-row duplication guard and record the deferral line. — why: one protocol shared by planner and reviewer is what stops a plan shipping an entity design that review then rejects.

## SYNC:integration-test-execution-discipline

> **Integration Test Execution Discipline** — How the integration-test family (write · review · verify) runs, diagnoses, and clears a suite. Binds `/integration-test`, `/integration-test-review`, and `/integration-test-verify` identically.
>
> 1. **Verify the WHOLE system passes — not a hand-picked subset.** `/integration-test-verify` must prove the full relevant suite is green (every test in the system the change can touch), not one cherry-picked test. "All pass" is only true with actual runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + names) and only after 2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset.
> 2. **Drive state through real use-case paths — NEVER hack seed data.** Set up every precondition exactly as a real user would: real commands, queries, production consumers/messages, or valid idempotent seeders. NEVER create or mutate domain data by direct repository writes — that fabricates states a user could never reach and hides the real workflow bug. Hacking seed data to force a green run is forbidden.
> 3. **On ANY failure → `/debug-investigate` the root cause BEFORE any fix.** Do not guess, do not patch the symptom site. Trace the failure end-to-start and classify whose fault it is: test code (wrong assertion/setup), source/production code (real defect), or environment/infrastructure/data. Then route: test-code fault → `/integration-test-review` to fix the test at the root (never weaken assertions or add skips); source-code fault → fix the production defect at the owning layer and report it; environment fault → mark BLOCKED and point at the startup script. NEVER change a test to match broken code.
> 4. **60-second runtime cap — a slow test is a RED FLAG, not a tuning knob.** Local integration tests run fast. If any single test (or a stalled suite) exceeds ~60s, STOP and treat the slowness itself as a defect signal — deadlock, missing `await`, infinite poll/retry, a real network/external call, or an unbounded query. `/debug-investigate` the cause; NEVER paper over it by raising the timeout or extending the wait.
> 5. **Loop until the whole suite is green.** After fixing the validated root cause, restart the full 2-run verification from run 1. Done means the entire relevant suite passes repeatably — never green-once, never a subset.

## SYNC:design-patterns-quality

> **Design Patterns Quality** — Priority checks for every code change:
>
> 1. **DRY via OOP:** Identify classes/modules with the same purpose, naming pattern, or lifecycle. Apply your knowledge of the project's language/framework to determine the idiomatic abstraction (base class, mixin, trait, protocol, decorator). 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
> 2. **Right Responsibility:** Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
> 3. **SOLID:** Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
> 4. **After extraction/move/rename:** Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
> 5. **YAGNI gate:** NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
>
> **Anti-patterns to flag:** God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.
>
> **Serial Attention for Design Quality** — Scan one quality dimension at a time (serial passes), not all concerns at once. — why: split attention misses violations that single-focus passes catch.
>
> 1. **Identify applicable dimensions** — Based on the code's language, domain, and patterns, determine which quality dimensions apply: DRY, SOLID principles (SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP), OOP idioms, cohesion/coupling, GRASP, Law of Demeter, CQRS invariants, etc. Your list is NOT fixed — derive from what the code actually does.
> 2. **One focused pass per dimension** — Dedicate single-focus attention to EACH dimension in sequence. Do NOT mix concerns across passes.
> 3. **Threshold: 3+ similar patterns = MANDATORY extraction** — Not optional suggestion. Flag as mandatory structural fix requiring action.
> 4. **2+ violations of same kind = structural finding** — Report as "pattern problem" needing architectural resolution, not a list of individual instances.

## SYNC:complexity-prevention

> **Complexity Prevention (Ousterhout)** — MANDATORY. Measure code by cost of change: one business change should map to one code change. Flag ALL of the following in review:
>
> 1. **Change amplification** — small business change forces edits in >3 places → structural flaw. Count edit sites for a plausible future change (add variant, add field, add authorization). >3 = reject.
> 2. **Cognitive load** — reader must hold too much context to safely modify. Flag deep inheritance, long parameter lists, boolean traps, implicit ordering dependencies.
> 3. **Cross-cutting duplication at entry points** — logging, error handling, validation, auth, transactions reimplemented per controller/handler/route. Lift to middleware / interceptor / filter / decorator / aspect.
> 4. **Leaked implementation technology** — repos returning `IQueryable`/`QuerySet`/`Criteria`/raw cursors/ORM entities to callers. Return finished results + intent-revealing methods (`GetActiveVipUsers()` not `Query()`).
> 5. **Type-switch scattering** — `switch`/`if`-chains on enum/discriminator in >1 place. New variant = new file, not N edits. One factory/registry switch at the boundary OK; scattered switches = reject.
> 6. **Anemic models** — domain objects with only getters/setters, logic floats in services. Move invariants/behavior onto the object (`order.Checkout()`, not `order.Status = ...`).
> 7. **Primitive obsession** — raw `string`/`int`/`decimal` for account numbers, emails, money, percentages, date ranges, with re-validation at every entry. Wrap in value objects / records / structs that validate once at construction.
> 8. **Inline cross-cutting concerns** — authorization/tenant isolation/audit/sanitization hand-written at top of every handler. Flag intent with declarative markers (`@RequirePermission("Order.Delete")`), enforce once centrally.
> 9. **Shallow modules** — tiny class, big interface (many public methods, many flags, many ctor params) wrapping little logic. A module is deep when a small interface hides a lot of implementation. If interface ≈ implementation cost to learn → inline.
> 10. **Missing base class for repeated component/handler lifecycle** — 3+ forms/CRUD handlers/list views reimplementing loading/dirty/submit/pagination → extract to base class / hook / composable / mixin / trait.
> 11. **Premature vs delayed abstraction** — rule-of-three. First occurrence: write it. Second: notice duplication. Third: extract. Don't build generic frameworks before real variation; don't copy-paste for the 4th time.
> 12. **Embedded utility logic not extracted to helpers** — inline paging loops (`while (hasMore) { skip += take; ... }`), ad-hoc datetime math, string parsing/formatting, collection partitioning, retry/backoff loops, URL/query-string building. If the algorithm is non-trivial AND stack-generic (not business-specific), extract to `util`/`helper`/`extensions` and let consumers call one line. Inline duplicates → duplicated bug surface.
> 13. **Logic in wrong (higher) layer — downshift to callee** — business/derivation logic written in the caller when the callee owns the data. Defaults: Controller code that should be App Service. App Service code that should be Domain Service or Entity. Component code that should be ViewModel/Store/Service. Caller reaching into callee's data shape to compute something → move the computation behind an intent-revealing method on the callee. Lowest responsible layer wins (Entity > Domain Service > App Service > Controller · Model/VM > Store > Component). Higher-layer placement = duplicated logic when a sibling caller needs the same thing.
> 14. **Owner owns the rule — extract on first write** — if a caller inlines logic that derives, normalizes, validates, or computes from another type's data, MOVE it to the owning type. Single use is sufficient — the trigger is wrong responsibility, not duplication. Sibling callers always arrive; inline copies drift silently with no compile error and no name to grep. **Common offenders:** _Backend_ — inlined rules in application-layer handlers / commands / queries / services / controllers that belong on the domain entity / value object / domain service. _Frontend_ — inlined derivations / formatting / validation in components that belong on the model / store / view-model / API service. **Fix:** name the rule once as a method (static or instance) on the owning type; callers invoke by name. Future variant → SECOND named method on the owner, never an inline near-duplicate. **Right responsibility first; reuse is the consequence.**

> **Operating heuristics:**
>
> - Write the call site first.
> - Count edit sites for plausible future change.
> - Prefer removing code over adding it.
> - Surface assumptions at boundaries, hide details inside.
> - **Pre-reuse scan** — before writing a non-trivial block, grep for similar algorithms (`while.*skip`, `DateTime.*Add`, `split`/`join` chains, paging loops, retry loops). Match existing helper → call it. None exists but pattern is stack-generic → extract to util before second caller appears.
> - **Layer placement test** — ask "if a sibling caller needed this tomorrow, would they re-derive it?" If yes, the logic is in the wrong layer. Move it down.
> - **Open-case-for-future-reuse** — if reviewer spots a block that is likely to appear in another feature (domain-agnostic algorithm, shared lifecycle, recurring derivation), do NOT rationalize with pure YAGNI. Either extract now (if cheap) or create a tracked TODO with the exact extraction target so the second caller does not duplicate silently. Silent duplication is the default failure mode.
> - When in doubt ask: "What would need to change if the requirement shifts?"
>
> **The measure of good code is the cost of change.** Not shortest. Not cleverest. Not most abstracted. Cheapest to safely modify having read a small local portion.

> 4. **Docker Development Environment** — compose profiles (`dev`/`test`/`infra`), multi-stage Dockerfile, health checks on all services, non-root production user.
> 5. **Integration Points** — document each outbound boundary; configure retry + circuit breaker + timeout; integration tests for happy path and failure path.
>
> **BLOCK `/feature-implement` if any foundation is unchecked.** Present 2-3 options per concern via `AskUserQuestion` before implementing.

## SYNC:scale-technique-gate

> **Scalability & Production-Readiness Technique Gate** — CONDITIONAL, evidence-gated, scale-tiered. Judge which system-design techniques a system _warrants_ at its scale — flag warranted-but-missing gaps AND advise AGAINST unwarranted heavyweight ones. **ADVICE-ONLY: emit the matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.**
>
> 1. **Derive the scale tier FIRST — from evidence, never assumed.** Read users/RPS, SLO/latency targets, data volume, tenancy, topology from config/infra/specs; cite `file:line` + confidence. Tiers: `T0` internal/single-instance · `T1` small SaaS (<10k users) · `T2` high-scale (10k–1M) · `T3` massive/multi-region (millions+). Unknown tier → state assumption, do NOT default to T3.
> 2. **Judge each concern group only at/above its warranting tier** (member techniques → owning review skill for depth):
>     - Traffic & Edge — Rate Limiting, Load Balancing, Reverse Proxy, API Gateway, CDN, Edge Caching, WAF, DDoS (T1+; CDN/WAF T2+) → security-review owns WAF/DDoS
>     - Caching & Data Access — Caching, Cache Invalidation, DB Indexing, Query Optimization, N+1, Connection Pooling (T1+) → performance-review owns depth
>     - Data Scaling & Consistency — Read Replicas, Sharding, Partitioning, Replication, CAP, Eventual Consistency, Locks, Leader Election (T2+; sharding/multi-region T3) → performance-review
>     - Async & Messaging — Message Queues, Pub/Sub, Event-Driven, Saga, DLQ, Distributed Transactions, Backpressure, Webhooks, WebSockets/SSE (T2+)
>     - Resilience — Circuit Breakers, Timeouts, Retries, Backoff, Idempotency, Health Checks, Liveness/Readiness, Failover, Graceful Degradation (T1+) → production-readiness-review
>     - Scaling & Compute — Autoscaling, Horizontal/Vertical Scaling, Serverless Limits, Cold Starts, Cron Jobs, Thread Safety, GC/Memory Leaks (T1+; autoscaling T2+)
>     - Deployment & Release — CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Blue-Green/Canary/Rolling, Rollbacks, Feature Flags, IaC/Terraform/Helm, Build Caching (CI/CD T0+; K8s/canary T2+)
>     - Observability — Monitoring, Logging, Distributed Tracing, Metrics, Alerting, SLOs/SLIs, Error Budgets (T1+; tracing/error-budgets T2+) → production-readiness-review
>     - Security & Compliance — Secrets Management, IAM, OAuth, JWT Rotation, TLS, Encryption at Rest/Transit, CORS, CSRF, SQLi, XSS, SSRF (T0+) → security-review owns
>     - DR & Infra — Backups, Disaster Recovery, Multi-Region, Chaos Engineering, Schema Versioning, DB Migrations, Cost Optimization (backups T1+; DR/multi-region/chaos T3) → production-readiness-review
> 3. **Assign one of 4 verdicts per warranted technique:** `PRESENT` · `MISSING-WARRANTED` (→ **advise only** — guidance, NOT a score/gate lever) · `N/A-by-scale` (below warranting tier) · `OVER-ENGINEERED` (present but unwarranted at this tier → advise AGAINST).
> 4. **Anti-over-engineering guard (first-class):** do NOT recommend K8s, sharding, multi-region, service mesh, event sourcing, or distributed transactions below their warranting tier. A correctly-lean small system is a PASS, never a gap.
> 5. **Output — Technique Applicability Matrix:** `technique | tier-warranted? | present? | verdict | advice | evidence (file:line/config/infra)`. Full grouped catalog + per-tier baseline → `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md`. Hosting reviews surface this matrix WITHOUT changing any `/20`, `/24`, verdict band, or PASS/FAIL (per user decision 2026-07-06). **Drift-guard: tier thresholds & per-technique warranting tiers are AUTHORITATIVE in `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md` — the inline tier summary above is a condensed pointer; on any tier/technique change, update the catalog FIRST, then re-run `.claude/scripts/inject_scale_technique_gate.py` to re-propagate this block.**

## SYNC:scale-technique-gate:reminder

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** scale-technique gate: derive the scale tier from evidence FIRST (T0 internal · T1 <10k · T2 10k–1M · T3 millions+), then judge each warranted technique `PRESENT`/`MISSING-WARRANTED`/`N/A-by-scale`/`OVER-ENGINEERED`. Advise on warranted-but-missing gaps AND advise AGAINST unwarranted heavyweight techniques (anti-over-engineering). **ADVICE-ONLY — emit the Technique Applicability Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.** Full catalog → `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md` (authoritative for tier thresholds & per-technique warranting tiers — on any change update the catalog FIRST, then re-run `inject_scale_technique_gate.py`).

## SYNC:scenario-stress-eval

> **Scenario Stress & Resilience Evaluation** — CONDITIONAL, evidence-gated, business-criticality-aware. The top-down companion to `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`: instead of _"is technique X present?"_, put the system UNDER concrete failure/load scenarios and judge whether it SURVIVES, SELF-HEALS, and whether its BUSINESS needs it to. **ADVICE-ONLY: emit the Scenario Stress Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.**
>
> 1. **Reuse the scale tier** derived by `SYNC:scale-technique-gate` (or derive it identically from evidence); **also derive business-criticality `B0`–`B3`** from specs/SLA/product docs + the domain, cite `file:line` + confidence. `B0` best-effort · `B1` important · `B2` business-critical · `B3` mission-critical/regulated. Unknown → state the assumption, do **NOT** default to `B3`/`T3`. **Criticality-signal floor (both-directions safety):** regulated / PII / financial / health data, money movement, auth/identity, or legal-compliance scope raises `B` to **at least `B2` even absent SLA/SLO docs**; anti-over-engineering lowers hardening ONLY when NO such signal is present. `B` (blast if it fails) and `T` (scale of load/data) are independent — a low-traffic payroll run is low-`T`, high-`B`.
> 2. **Select in-scope scenarios** — only those the system's `B`/`T` combination warrants (a `B0` internal PoC skips region-loss/DR entirely; a `B3`/`T0` regulated service still needs backups + DR by BUSINESS, not scale).
> 3. **Walk each in-scope scenario:** simulate the stimulus → trace the break path → name the failure signature → answer the self-heal/recovery question (auto-recover? MTTR? manual runbook?) → name the trade-off it forces. Families: traffic spike · sustained growth · data-volume growth · write/ingest burst · dependency down/slow · instance/node loss · zone/region loss · **data loss/corruption** · poison-message/retry-storm · cascading failure/backpressure · cold-start/deploy-blip · clock-skew/duplicate-delivery.
> 4. **Assign one verdict per scenario:** `WITHSTANDS` · `DEGRADES-GRACEFULLY` · `FAILS-HARD` (→ **advise only**) · `N/A-by-business` (not warranted → skip, not a gap) · `OVER-HARDENED` (resilience beyond business need → **advise AGAINST**, cite carrying cost).
> 5. **Anti-over-engineering guard (first-class):** a lean system whose business does not need HA/DR is a PASS; `OVER-HARDENED` flags resilience the business does not warrant. This guard is symmetric with the criticality-signal floor above — never under-harden a `B2`+ system just because its traffic is low.
> 6. **Output — Scenario Stress Matrix:** `scenario | in-scope (B/T)? | verdict | self-heal | trade-off | evidence (file:line/config/infra)`. Full catalog + Business×Scale in-scope baseline + verdict/tier tables → `.claude/docs/scenario-stress-catalog.md`. **ADVISORY-ONLY: NEVER mutate any `/20`, `/24`, verdict band, or gate pass/fail. Drift-guard: scenarios/verdicts/business-tiers are AUTHORITATIVE in the catalog — update it FIRST, then re-run `.claude/scripts/inject_scenario_stress_gate.py`. Scale tier stays single-sourced in `scale-technique-catalog.md`.**
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` scale tier + business-criticality (with criticality-signal floor) derived from evidence `- [ ]` in-scope scenarios selected `- [ ]` matrix emitted `- [ ]` over-hardening guard applied `- [ ]` advisory-only (no score/verdict mutation) confirmed

---

## SYNC:scenario-stress-eval:reminder

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** scenario-stress gate: reuse the scale tier `T0`–`T3` AND derive business-criticality `B0`–`B3` from evidence first — apply the **criticality-signal floor** (regulated/PII/financial/health data · money movement · auth/identity · legal-compliance → at least `B2` even absent SLA docs; do NOT default to `B3`). Select only the scenarios the `B`/`T` combination warrants, then walk each (simulate → trace → failure signature → self-heal/MTTR → trade-off) and assign `WITHSTANDS`/`DEGRADES-GRACEFULLY`/`FAILS-HARD`/`N/A-by-business`/`OVER-HARDENED`. Anti-over-engineering is first-class (a lean system that needs no HA/DR is a PASS) AND symmetric (never under-harden a `B2`+ system for low traffic). **ADVICE-ONLY — emit the Scenario Stress Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.** Full catalog → `.claude/docs/scenario-stress-catalog.md` (authoritative for scenarios/verdicts/business-tiers — on any change update the catalog FIRST, then re-run `inject_scenario_stress_gate.py`; scale tier stays single-sourced in `scale-technique-catalog.md`).

## SYNC:harness-setup

> **Harness Engineering** — An outer agent harness has two jobs: raise first-attempt quality + provide self-correction feedback loops before human review.
>
> **Controls split:**
>

>
> **Test-strength sensor — gate on mutation score, NOT line coverage.** Line coverage is a DIAGNOSTIC only: low coverage is a useful NEGATIVE signal (something is untested); high coverage is NOT evidence of quality (tests can execute lines without asserting intent) — NEVER fail a build on a line-coverage %. The real test-strength metric is **mutation score** (inject faults into changed code; surviving mutant = a missing/weak assertion = write the killing test); gate the build on it where a mutation tool exists. Add **property coverage** as a second sensor — each [HARD] §4 rule / §5 invariant guarded by ≥1 property/metamorphic test. The property tests themselves are REQUIRED for invariant-owning behaviors (`spec [mode=tests]` + `integration-test` force them, not opt-in); what is optional is only wiring property coverage as an _automated CI sensor_ on top. Keep **behavior/change-coverage** (does each behavior-changing file have a test that asserts the changed outcome) — that notion is meaningful and stays.
>
> **Three harness types:**
>
> 1. **Maintainability** — Complexity, duplication, line-coverage (diagnostic only — never a gate), style. Easiest: rich deterministic tooling.
> 2. **Architecture fitness** — Module boundaries, dependency direction, performance budgets, observability conventions.
> 3. **Behaviour** — Functional correctness. Hardest: gate on mutation score + property coverage; line coverage stays a diagnostic.
>
> **Keep quality left:** pre-commit sensors fire first (cheap), CI sensors fire second, post-review last (expensive).
>
> **Research-driven:** Never hardcode tool choices. Detect tech stack → research ecosystem → present top 2-3 options → user decides. Enforce strictest defaults; loosen only with explicit approval.
>
> **Harnessability signals:** Strong typing, explicit module boundaries, opinionated frameworks = easier to harness. Treat these as greenfield architectural choices, not just style preferences.

## SYNC:two-stage-task-review

> **Two-Stage Task Review** — Both stages MUST ATTENTION complete before marking task done.
>
> **Stage 1: Self-review** — Immediately after implementation:
>
> - Requirements met? No regressions? Code quality acceptable?
>
> **Stage 2: Cross-review** — Via `code-reviewer` subagent:
>
> - Catches blind spots, convention drift, missed edge cases
>
> **NEVER skip Stage 2.** Self-review alone misses 40%+ of issues.

---

## SYNC:web-research

> **Web Research** — Structured web search for evidence gathering.
>
> 1. Form 3-5 specific search queries (not generic questions)
> 2. Use WebSearch for each query, collect top 3-5 sources
> 3. Validate source credibility (official docs > blogs > forums)
> 4. Cross-validate claims across 2+ sources before citing
> 5. Write findings to research report with source URLs
>
> **NEVER cite a single source as authoritative. Always cross-validate.**

---

## SYNC:graph-impact-analysis

> **Graph Impact Analysis** — When `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, run `blast-radius --json` to detect ALL files affected by changes (7 edge types: CALLS, MESSAGE_BUS, API_ENDPOINT, TRIGGERS_EVENT, PRODUCES_EVENT, TRIGGERS_COMMAND_EVENT, INHERITS). Compute gap: impacted_files - changed_files = potentially stale files. Risk: <5 Low, 5-20 Medium, >20 High. Use `trace --direction downstream` for deep chains on high-impact files.

---

## SYNC:ui-wireframe

> **UI Wireframe** — Process visual design input (Figma URLs, screenshots, wireframes) via appropriate tool BEFORE creating wireframes. Use box-drawing ASCII characters for spatial layout. Classify every component into exactly ONE tier: Common (cross-app reusable) / Domain-Shared (cross-domain) / Page (single-page). Duplicate UI code = wrong tier. Search existing component libraries before creating new (>=80% match = reuse). Detail level varies by skill (idea=rough, story=full decomposition).

---

## SYNC:ui-wireframe-protocol

> **UI Wireframe Protocol** — Wireframe-to-implementation flow: (1) Process design input (Figma/screenshot/sketch via visual analysis tooling). (2) Create ASCII wireframe with box-drawing chars. (3) Build component inventory with tier classification (Common/Domain-Shared/Page). (4) Document states (Default/Loading/Empty/Error). (5) Map to design tokens. (6) Define responsive breakpoints. Search existing component libraries before creating new. Progressive detail by skill level (idea=sketch, story=full tree+specs).

---

## SYNC:knowledge-graph-template

> **Knowledge Graph Template** — For each analyzed file, document: filePath, type (entity, command, query, event handler, controller, consumer, component, store, service, or repository-specific equivalent), architecturalPattern, content summary, symbols, dependencies, businessContext, referenceFiles, relevanceScore (1-10), evidenceLevel (verified/inferred), abstractions, and moduleContext. Investigation fields: entryPoints, outputPoints, dataTransformations, errorScenarios. Messaging fields: messageName, messageProducers, crossBoundaryIntegration. UI fields: componentHierarchy, stateManagementStores, dataBindingPatterns, validationStrategies.

---

## SYNC:module-detection

> **Module Detection** — Detect target module from PBI/idea keywords. Match against `docs/specs/` directory names. Load `docs/specs/{module}/` context for domain rules. If ambiguous, ask user. Module list derived from codebase — do NOT hardcode.

---

## SYNC:ba-team-decision-model

> **BA Team Decision Model** — 2/3 majority vote: Dev BA PIC + UX BA + Designer BA per squad. 2 of 3 agree = decision final. 3-way split = escalate to full squad + Tech Leads + Engineering Manager.
>
> **Technical Veto:** Dev BA PIC can unilaterally veto on: architecture feasibility, dependency correctness, cross-service impact, performance, security. CANNOT veto: UI/UX design, visual design, business value, user research.
>
> **Rules:** Disagree-and-commit after vote. Grooming override requires >75% non-BA squad vote. Record decisions in PBI Validation Summary (member, role, vote, notes).
>
> **Escalation:** Tech uncertainty → Engineering Manager. Business value → PO. Design feasibility → UX BA + Designer BA consensus.

---

## SYNC:refinement-dor-checklist

> **Refinement DoR Checklist** — ALL 7 criteria MUST ATTENTION pass before grooming:
>
> 1. **User story template** — "As a {role}, I want {goal}, so that {benefit}" format
> 2. **AC testable & unambiguous** — GIVEN/WHEN/THEN. No "should/might/TBD/various/appropriate". Min 3 scenarios (happy, edge, error) + 1 auth scenario
> 3. **Wireframes attached** — UI features: `## UI Layout` with wireframe + components + states + tokens. Backend-only: explicit "N/A"
> 4. **UI design ready** — Visual design + component decomposition tree + design-spec linked (`/design-spec` artifact or inline UI specs in `## UI Layout`) for any PBI with UI work. Backend-only: "N/A"
> 5. **AI pre-review passed** — `/artifact-review --type=pbi` or `/pbi-challenge` returned PASS or WARN (not FAIL)
> 6. **Story points estimated** — Fibonacci 1-21 + complexity (Low/Medium/High). >13 SP → recommend split
> 7. **Dependencies table complete** — Dependency, Type (must-before/can-parallel/blocked-by/independent), Status
>
> **Failure fixes:** Vague AC → specify exact CRUD + roles. Missing auth → add roles × CRUD table. No wireframes → UX BA creates. TBD in AC → replace with decision.

## SYNC:design-system-check

> **Design System Check** — Before ANY frontend work, read docs relevant to task type:
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — tokens, components, icons, themes
> 2. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — base classes, stores, forms, API services
> 3. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM, SCSS vars, mixins, responsive
>
> App-specific paths: check `docs/project-config.json` → `designSystem.appMappings[]` and `contextGroups[]`.

## SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide

> **Project Reference Docs Gate** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read `docs/project-config.json` first — the project's machine-readable map.** It is the single source of truth for THIS repo (modules/paths, framework + search keywords, test/E2E/integration run-commands, design system, architecture rules, workflow patterns); ground exact paths, run-commands, and conventions on it **before investigating, planning, or coding** — never assume framework defaults (`CLAUDE.md` + reference docs are derived from it). If it — or the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any required reference doc — is missing or stale, auto-run `/project-init` or the narrow route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan-all`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/claude-md-init`) first; if Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are stale, ask the user to run `/sync-codex` (never auto-run it).
> 3. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 4. Read every required doc, then before target work state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, `docs/project-config.json` consulted, required docs checked/read or setup route completed, `lessons.md` confirmed, citation emitted.

---

## SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Before investigating, planning, or coding, read `docs/project-config.json` (the project map: modules/paths, run-commands, conventions, architecture/workflow rules) + the required project-reference docs, and cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Always include `lessons.md`; project config + conventions override generic framework defaults.
- **MANDATORY** If project config, root instruction files, or any required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `/project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:project-protocol-overlay

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

---

## SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

---

## SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy

> **Shared Protocol Duplication Policy** — Inline protocol content in skills (wrapped in `<!-- SYNC:tag -->`) is INTENTIONAL duplication. Do NOT extract, deduplicate, or replace with file references. AI compliance drops significantly when protocols are behind file-read indirection. To update: edit `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` first, then grep `SYNC:protocol-name` and update all occurrences.

---

## SYNC:fresh-context-review

> **Fresh Context Re-Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias after fixes by restarting the full review with isolated sub-agents where applicable.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/feature-implement`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** ONLY after a validated-finding fix cycle. A review round that finds zero issues ENDS the loop — do NOT spawn a confirmation sub-agent. A review round that finds issues triggers: validate findings → fix → full review restart from the first phase.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Start a NEW full review invocation/task breakdown; when that protocol calls for agents, spawn NEW `Agent` tool calls — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - SKIP fresh sub-agent when the prior full review found zero issues (no fixes = nothing new to verify)
> - NEVER skip the full review restart after a fix cycle — every fix invalidates the prior verdict
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every fresh round spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - Continue until a complete full review pass clears that round's exit bar per `SYNC:double-round-trip-review`: **rounds 1-2** → zero findings at any severity; **round 3+** → zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop (list those LOWs as deferred instead of spawning another round). If the same blocker repeats 3 times with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`
> - Track iteration count and repeated blockers in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

---

## SYNC:review-protocol-injection

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 11 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 11 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 11 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
DO THIS FIRST — before any per-protocol check below. The review target is the WHOLE PACKAGE, not the diff alone: load the behavior's spec (§3 ACs / §4 BRs / §8 TCs), its tests, and the changed code TOGETHER, and reason about their mutual consistency BEFORE judging any one in isolation.
1. Locate all three faces: the Feature Spec section(s) governing the changed behavior, the tests that guard it, and the production code that implements it. A missing face is itself a finding (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise — every disagreement is a finding; classify which face is wrong:
   - code vs spec: behavior the code does that no §3/§4/§8 rule describes → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a [HARD] §4 rule or §5 invariant with no enforcing code path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: a §8 TC with no test, or a test asserting behavior no TC/rule names → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT.
   - tests vs code: a changed code path with no covering test → TEST-GAP; a test that still passes against a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: any invariant the code enforces but the spec never states (SPEC-SILENT) MUST be surfaced as a finding to add into §3/§4/§8 AND guarded with a test — the enrichment loop, never a silent pass.
4. Only after the three faces agree — or every disagreement is logged as a finding — proceed to the per-protocol checks below; when enrichment adds spec/test content, re-review the package against the enriched spec.
NEVER mark review PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
5. Tests Verify Intent: For test/spec changes, verify tests name the protected business rule or invariant and would fail if that intent breaks.
6. Migration Test Exclusion: Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. Identify the project's test/spec format from existing docs, test-case files, BDD feature files, or spec folders.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding test case/spec (or flag as "needs test case").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Migration files are excluded from test/spec creation; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
5. If spec evidence fields exist, verify they point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
6. Verify each meaningful test case names the business intent/invariant; flag behavior-only cases that only mirror implementation details.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. If no specs exist for a changed path → log the gap and recommend the project's test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` — canonical development rules, code-quality guidelines, and pre-commit checklist
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

>
> NEVER mark PASS while any face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

---

## SYNC:repeatable-test-principle

> **Infinitely Repeatable Tests** — Tests MUST run N times without failure. Like manual QC — run the suite 100 times, each run just adds more data. Verification is only PASS after the relevant suite/project passes 2 consecutive runs without database reset.
>
> 1. **Unique data per run:** Use the project's unique ID generator for ALL entity IDs created in tests. NEVER hardcode IDs.
> 2. **Additive only:** Tests create data, never delete/reset. Prior test runs MUST NOT interfere with current run.
> 3. **No schema rollback dependency:** Tests work with current schema only. Never rely on schema rollback or migration reversals.
> 4. **Idempotent seeders:** Fixture-level seeders use create-if-missing pattern (check existence before insert). Test-level data uses unique IDs per execution.
> 5. **No cleanup required:** No teardown, no database reset between runs. Each test is isolated by unique seed data, not by cleanup.
> 6. **Unique names/codes:** When entities require unique names/codes, append a unique suffix using the project's ID generator.
> 7. **Migration code excluded:** Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

---

## SYNC:test-data-isolation

> **Parallel-Safe Test Isolation** — Tests MUST run in parallel and still pass; no test's data may be affected by any other test. `repeatable-test-principle` guards a test against its OWN prior runs; THIS guards it against OTHER concurrent tests, including indirect corruption through a shared parent + a cross-cutting consumer.
>
> 1. **Own fresh data per test:** Each test creates its own entities with unique IDs, down to the root it asserts on. NEVER assert against a shared mutable entity another test can change; only immutable reference/lookup data may be shared — why: shared mutable state is the single point another test corrupts.
> 2. **Isolate at the highest mutated entity:** Own a private instance of the highest-level entity (aggregate root/parent) any test mutates. Sharing is safe only for data no test ever writes — why: a writable shared parent is contended ground two tests fight over.
> 3. **Account for cross-cutting consumers:** A bulk re-sync, recompute, projection rebuild, or cascade any test triggers over a shared parent can rewrite or wipe every entity beneath it — so sharing that parent is unsafe EVEN WHEN your test never mutates it directly — why: the corruption arrives through a consumer, not the path under test.
> 4. **Suspect contamination FIRST on contradiction:** When a test fails intermittently, or its result contradicts the traced behavior of the path under test (the path is provably innocent yet state is wrong), rule out cross-test interference BEFORE blaming the code under test — why: the innocent path takes the blame for another test's writes.
> 5. **Prove isolation by search, not assumption:** Grep every OTHER test touching the same shared data AND every consumer that fans out over it; cite `file:line` evidence. Absence of a sharer is a finding to prove, not assume — why: isolation claimed without a search is unverified.

## SYNC:real-world-fidelity-testing

> **Real-World Fidelity Gate** — MANDATORY when authoring, reviewing, or repairing any integration / E2E / system test.
>
> A test earns trust by reproducing a situation the system can actually meet in production. A scenario that could never occur in real life proves nothing when it passes, and wastes hours when it fails.
>
> 1. **Ask the fidelity question BEFORE writing the setup:** _"Can this sequence, timing, and data actually occur in production?"_ If no, the test is mis-specified — fix the SCENARIO, never the assertion.
> 2. **Model real pacing between actor steps.** Two distinct actor actions that production separates by seconds, minutes, or hours MUST NOT be fired back-to-back in the same millisecond. Compressed pacing manufactures races the system was never designed to survive, then reports them as product defects.
> 3. **Wait on a real signal, never a blind sleep.** Find an observable proving the prior step finished — a persisted state change, an audit/version stamp, a queue/worker idle marker, a completion event — and poll until it settles (unchanged across a short stability window). Use a fixed delay ONLY when no observable exists, and say so in a comment.
> 4. **Barriers belong in ARRANGE, never in ASSERT.** Waiting for a precondition is fidelity. Widening an assertion's timeout, loosening a comparison, adding a retry around a failing assertion, or skipping the test is masking. NEVER do the latter to force green.
> 5. **Distinguish harness-amplified from real.** Test topologies (shared infra, fan-out consumers, parallel suites, cold starts) can make a rare production race routine locally. Before filing a product defect, state whether the trigger exists in production and at what likelihood.
> 6. **Keep the protected invariant intact.** Improving fidelity must NEVER reduce what the test protects. If a realistic scenario no longer exercises the rule, the rule needs a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — not a weaker assertion.
> 7. **Deliberate impossible-state tests are allowed, but MUST be labelled.** Corruption-repair, migration, and fail-safe tests intentionally construct states production should never reach; comment WHY the state is reachable (upstream bug, partial write, legacy data), so they are never confused with unrealistic setups.

## SYNC:context-engineering-principles

> **Context Engineering Principles** — Research-backed principles for prompt quality. Source: Anthropic prompt engineering guide, Stanford "lost-in-the-middle" research, 2025-2026 LLM context optimization studies.
>
> 1. **Primacy-Recency Effect** — LLM performance drops 15-47% for middle-context information (Stanford). AI attention peaks at first/last 10% of text. **Action:** Place the 3 most critical rules in both the first 5 lines AND the last 5 lines of every prompt. Queries at end improve quality by up to 30% (Anthropic).
> 2. **High-Signal Density** — Anthropic: _"Identify the smallest collection of high-signal tokens that maximize the probability of the desired outcome."_ **Action:** Every line should change AI behavior. If removing a line doesn't change output → cut it. Target ≥8 rules (MUST ATTENTION/NEVER/ALWAYS) per 100 lines.
> 3. **Context Rot** — LLM performance degrades as context length grows — even when all content is relevant. Compression (5-20x) maintains or improves accuracy while saving 70-94% tokens. **Action:** Compress aggressively. Shorter, denser prompts outperform longer, diluted ones.
> 4. **Structured > Prose** — Tables, bullets, XML/markdown parse faster than paragraphs. Constrained formats reduce error rates vs free-text. **Action:** Convert narrative to tables/bullets. Use markdown headers for semantic sections.
> 5. **RCCF Framework** — Modern LLMs (2025+) already know how to reason. What they need: **R**ole (personality), **C**ontext (grounding), **C**onstraints (guardrails), **F**ormat (structure). Constraints and format matter more than verbose instructions.
> 6. **Checkbox Avoidance** — `[ ]` syntax triggers mechanical compliance — AI ticks boxes without reasoning. Bullet rules force reading and evaluation. **Action:** Replace `- [ ] Check X` with `- MUST ATTENTION verify X`.
> 7. **Example Economy** — 3-5 examples optimal for few-shot; diminishing returns after. **Action:** 1 best example per pattern. Use BAD→GOOD pairs (2-3 lines each) for anti-patterns.
> 8. **Deferred Tool Loading** — Claude Code delays loading tool definitions when they exceed 10% of context window. **Action:** Keep injected docs well under 10% of context budget. Docs exceeding ~3,000 lines are too large for injection — split or compress.
> 9. **Rule Density Verification** — Post-optimization rule count (MUST ATTENTION/NEVER/ALWAYS) must be ≥ pre-optimization count. Compression should preserve or increase density, never decrease it. **Action:** Count before and after every optimization pass.
> 10. **Affirmative Directives** — Models comply with affirmative directives more reliably than prohibitions; a bare "don't X" leaves the correct action unspecified, so the model substitutes an arbitrary alternative. **Action:** State the action to take, not only the action to avoid. Keep `NEVER`/forbidden guardrails for hard invariants — but pair each with the right path ("Do X" not just "Don't do Y").
> 11. **Rationale-Carrying Instructions** — A rule shipped with its reason generalizes to edge cases the rule never enumerated and survives compression; a bare imperative gets misapplied or silently dropped. **Action:** Append a terse `— why: …` clause to every non-obvious rule. The reason names the failure prevented or outcome wanted — never restates the rule.

## SYNC:category-review-thinking

> **Category Review Thinking** — A thinking framework for reviewing any category of changed files. NOT a fixed checklist — derive concerns from domain knowledge; the examples are starting points only. Your knowledge of the category exceeds any list here — trust it.
>
> **Step 1 — Understand the category's role.** What is this category responsible for in the overall system? What invariants must it uphold? What are its consumer contracts (who depends on it, what do they expect)?
>
> **Step 2 — Read project conventions for this category.** Search for reference docs, style guides, ADRs, or READMEs specific to this area. Grep 3+ existing similar files — extract naming conventions, structural patterns, shared base classes. If no docs exist, derive conventions empirically from existing code.
>
> **Step 3 — Derive concerns from first principles.** Apply all that are relevant; expand beyond this list based on the actual category:
>
> - **Correctness:** Does the logic match the intent? Trace happy path AND error path.
> - **Boundary contracts:** Are interfaces/APIs/events/protocols honored? No implicit coupling introduced?
> - **Project conventions:** Does new code follow the patterns found in Step 2? Evidence-confirmed, not assumed.
> - **Security:** Auth enforced at every entry point? Input validated at boundaries? No secrets in the diff?
> - **Performance:** Unbounded operations? N+1 patterns? Blocking calls in async context? Unindexed queries?
> - **Maintainability:** DRY? Single responsibility? Complexity within reason? Names reveal intent?
> - **Test coverage:** Are the changed paths covered by tests? Are existing tests still valid after the change?
> - **Documentation:** Do related docs, specs, or READMEs reflect the changes?
>
> **Step 4 — Create sub-tasks and execute.** For each identified concern: create a `TaskCreate` sub-task, work through it with `file:line` evidence, mark done. No findings without proof.
>
> **Illustrative concern examples by category type** (not exhaustive — trust your knowledge beyond this):
>
> - _Server-side logic:_ handler/service structure conventions, validation layer placement, side-effect isolation, cross-service boundary enforcement, data-access layer separation, error propagation strategy
> - _Client-side logic:_ component lifecycle management, resource cleanup (subscriptions, listeners, timers), state management patterns, API integration layer separation, reactive stream composition
> - _Data/Schema:_ migration reversibility (rollback script), lock impact on table volume, backfill idempotency, index coverage for query patterns, deployment ordering
> - _Configuration:_ present in ALL environments? No secrets in diff? App fails fast if config missing (not silently null)? Documented in setup guide?
> - _Infrastructure:_ dev/prod parity? No hardcoded dev values (localhost, debug flags)? Pinned image/dependency versions? CI/CD secret requirements documented?
> - _Styles/Assets:_ follows project naming conventions? Uses design variables/tokens (no hardcoded magic values)? Correct scope (no global side effects from component styles)?
> - _Documentation:_ accurate? Links valid? Examples still match current code/behavior? Covers new scenarios?
> - _Tests:_ assertions verify specific outcomes (not just "no exception")? Idempotent (repeatable N times)? Covers edge cases, not just happy path?
> - _Security artifacts:_ all code paths reach the gate? Negative tests exist (unauthorized denied)? Both enforcement AND display control updated?
> - _Build/Tooling:_ rule changes apply consistently? No exceptions that silently swallow violations? Impact on CI runtime documented?

## SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Derive review categories from file language + directory semantics + change nature; create a sub-task per category.
- **MANDATORY** Derive each category's concerns from first principles with `file:line` evidence — never a fixed checklist.

## SYNC:systematic-review-batching

> **Systematic Review Batching (map-reduce)** — When a changeset is large, do NOT review files one-by-one. Partition into size-capped batches, fire one specialized sub-agent per batch in parallel, then reduce. This bounds EVERY context — each batch agent AND the orchestrator — so coverage stays complete as file count grows.
>
> **Trigger ladder (one ordered escalation — not competing thresholds):**
>
> 1. **< 10 changed files** → sequential per-file review (default; no batching).
> 2. **≥ 10 changed files** → switch to systematic parallel mode. Announce: `"Detected {N} changed files. Switching to systematic parallel review protocol."` Then: categorize → size-capped batches → flat consolidation.
> 3. **categories > 6 OR files > 40** → additionally insert the hierarchical synthesis tier (below). Everything from rung 2 still applies.
>
> **Step 1 — Categorize.** Group changed files into logical categories derived from the project's actual structure (not forced). Category is the _concern axis_; orient with these examples, derive what fits the repository:
>
> | Category Type       | Example Groupings                                                     |

> **Step 2 — Size-capped batches.** One sub-agent per batch of **≤8 files OR ≤2000 diff-lines**, whichever hits first. Category stays the concern axis, but any category exceeding a cap splits into multiple size-capped batches (30 backend files → 4 batches). Size caps — not category caps — make "many files" safe: a category cap alone lets one giant category blow a single agent's context.
>
> **Step 2a — Sub-agent type per batch** (match the batch's dominant concern):
>
> - Code logic (any stack) → `code-reviewer`
> - Security-sensitive changes → `security-auditor`
> - Performance-critical paths → `performance-optimizer`
> - Docs, plans, specs, configs, infra → `general-purpose`
>
> Each batch sub-agent receives: its full file list; `SYNC:category-review-thinking` as its primary thinking model — derive each category's concerns from first principles, NOT a fixed checklist (if the consuming skill does not carry that block, apply category-first thinking directly); project reference docs relevant to its concern (discover via `*patterns*`, `*conventions*`, `*style-guide*`); cross-reference verification instructions (counts, tables, links). All batch agents run in parallel and write findings to `plans/reports/` (per `SYNC:task-tracking-external-report`); reducers read from disk, never from memory.
>
> **Step 3 — Reduce.**
>
> - **Flat reduction (rung 2, ≤6 categories AND ≤40 files):** the orchestrator collects each batch report, cross-references counts/tables/contracts ACROSS batches, detects gaps visible only across categories (feature in code but missing from docs; new API endpoint with no client call), and consolidates into one categorized holistic report.
> - **Hierarchical reduction (rung 3, > 6 categories OR > 40 files):** insert a mid-tier — each concern gets ONE synthesizer agent that reads only its own batch reports and emits a single concern-synthesis. The orchestrator reads the **concern-syntheses (~5)**, never the raw batch reports — keeping the reducer's context O(#concerns), not O(#files).
>     - **Cross-concern interaction pass (mandatory at rung 3 — closes the synthesis-tier blind spot):** concern-siloed synthesis can drop an interaction spanning two concerns AND two batches (tainted source in data-layer/batch 7 → sink in api/batch 3). So: (a) each concern-synthesizer MUST emit an explicit **"cross-concern interaction candidates"** list — entities/symbols/contracts it touched that plausibly bind to another concern (shared DTOs, event names, table/collection names, exported symbols); (b) the orchestrator MUST run the Step-3 cross-reference/gap step **over those candidate lists across all concern-syntheses**, not only within a batch, before concluding. Without this pass the tier trades completeness for context-bounding on exactly the large diffs it targets.
>
> **Step 4 — Holistic assessment.** With all findings combined, judge: overall coherence as a unified intent; cross-category sync (docs match code? contracts match callers?); risk areas where categories interact; missing doc/spec updates for changed artifacts.
>
> **No silent truncation.** If any cap forces sampling or a batch is dropped for budget, ANNOUNCE the dropped/sampled scope explicitly — bounded coverage must never read as complete coverage.

## SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Large changeset → batch by size cap (≤8 files OR ≤2000 diff-lines), one parallel sub-agent per batch; never review many files one-by-one.
- **MANDATORY** > 6 categories OR > 40 files → add the hierarchical synthesis tier; each concern-synthesizer emits cross-concern interaction candidates and the orchestrator runs the cross-concern pass before concluding.

## SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate

> **Trade-Off Interrogation Gate** — ALWAYS ask these THREE questions before ANY verdict, score, finding, or recommendation — about the thing under review AND about every recommendation YOU make. — why: naming a benefit without its price is an endorsement, not a review; the costliest trade-offs are the ones nobody wrote down.
>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

## SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

## SYNC:subagent-return-contract

> **Sub-Agent Return Contract** — When this skill spawns a sub-agent, the sub-agent MUST return ONLY this structure. Main agent reads only this summary — NEVER requests full sub-agent output inline.

> **Context budget** — the return payload is a SUMMARY, not a transcript: ≤10 finding bullets, no raw file contents / full diffs / verbatim logs inline, no re-pasted source. Everything beyond the summary lives in the `Full report` on disk. A sub-agent that would exceed the summary shape MUST write the detail to its report and return only the pointer — the orchestrator's context is the scarce resource the whole map-reduce protects.

## SYNC:incremental-persistence

> **Incremental Result Persistence** — MANDATORY for all sub-agents or heavy inline steps processing >3 files.
>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `plans/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md`
> 2. **After each file/section reviewed:** Append findings to report immediately — never hold in memory
> 3. **Return to main agent:** Summary only (per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) with `Full report:` path
> 4. **Main agent:** Reads report file only when resolving specific blockers
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings. Each disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results.

## SYNC:task-tracking-external-report

> **Task Tracking & External Report Persistence** — Bootstrap this before execution; then run project-reference doc prefetch before target/source work.

## SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `plans/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

## SYNC:nested-task-creation

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

---

## SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

## SYNC:parallel-phase-advancement

> **Parallel-Phase Advancement (model-driven)** — How to run AND advance a declared parallel batch of workflow steps. Tool-agnostic: identical under Claude and Codex — neither depends on a hook. Mirrors the universal context-file rule ("Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases" in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md).
>
> 1. **Declare the group.** Name the members of the parallel phase up-front — which steps run together, and mark any conditional member with its trigger.
> 2. **Spawn ALL members in ONE message.** Dispatch every member together (multiple `Agent`/sub-agent calls in a single response) — never drip them one per turn.
> 3. **Barrier — advance ONLY after EVERY member returns.** A member is "returned" when its work completes inline OR its sub-agent returns; a conditional member whose trigger is absent counts as returned. Do NOT advance, and do NOT start the next step, until the whole group has returned.
> 4. **A sub-agent return advances the step identically to an inline call.** Advancement is YOUR judgment against the task list — never wait for a hook or tool event. Mark each member `completed` (or "Skipped — <reason>") as the batch resolves.
> 5. **Mutating steps wait for the barrier.** Never start a code-mutating step (e.g. `code-simplifier`) until the full batch has returned — it must act on the complete review snapshot, not a partial one.
> 6. **Hooks are accelerators only.** Any step-tracking hook may emit a "next step" hint as an optimization; correctness MUST NOT depend on it. Codex runs with no hooks and advances entirely by this rule.
>
> **Blocked until:** `- [ ]` all members spawned in one message `- [ ]` every member returned (incl. skipped conditional) `- [ ]` each member marked completed/skipped `- [ ]` mutating step deferred until after the barrier.

## SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

---

## SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

## SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

---

## SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:full

## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via Skill tool or `/start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.

## SYNC:agent-bootstrap

> **Plan first, then act.** Break work into small tasks before editing; keep exactly one task in progress; mark each complete immediately after its evidence lands. On context loss, inspect the existing task list before creating new tasks.
>
> **Context guard / progress file (MANDATORY when task > 5 files or > 3 steps).** Context exhaustion = silent loss of ALL findings; no progress file = no recovery.
>
> 1. **On start:** create `tmp/ck-agent-{ts}-{rnd}.progress.md` — `ts` = current timestamp in `YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS` (17 digits), `rnd` = random 6-char hex. First line records the session id.
> 2. **After each step:** append findings, marking `[done]` / `[partial]` / `[pending]`.
> 3. **Running out of context?** Write `[partial]` to the file FIRST — NEVER summarize before writing.
> 4. **Producing a report?** Persist it incrementally to `plans/reports/` and start the final message with its path.
>
> **Blocked until:** task breakdown exists · progress file created when the task exceeds the size threshold.

## SYNC:agent-code-standards

> **Development rules.** YAGNI / KISS / DRY. Place logic in the LOWEST layer (Entity/Model > Service > Component/Handler) — mapping → Command/DTO, constants → Model. Kebab-case files. Search 3+ existing patterns before writing new code; read existing code before changing it. Read `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` for full coding standards, quality gates, and the pre-commit checklist (when present).
>
> **Coding patterns.** Before implementing, read the project pattern references named in `docs/project-config.json` / the docs index (e.g. `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`, `frontend-patterns-reference.md`) — local conventions override generic framework defaults.
>
> **Blocked until:** dev-rules + pattern docs read before writing or changing code.

## SYNC:source-test-drift-check

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

---

## SYNC:tc-test-join-evidence

> 1. **The resolved artifact is a TEST** — test project/suite membership, a test-framework annotation, or an executing assertion. Say which you checked. A corpus search matches production source too; implementations routinely cite in a comment the TC they satisfy.
> 2. **The resolved test's SUBJECT matches this TC's `Given/When/Then`.** TC IDs are not guaranteed unique — the same ID may be bound by an unrelated test or one in a different module. An ID match is a string match; only the body match is evidence.

---

## SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication

> **Spec drift adjudication (code-wrong vs spec-stale).** Whenever changed behavior diverges from a canonical Feature Spec (business rule, acceptance criterion, flow, state transition, or §8 TC under `docs/specs/`), you MUST NOT silently pick a side. Adjudicate per `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → **Drift Gates**:
>
> 1. **Detect** — compare the change against the spec's documented intent. No divergence → record `Spec in sync` and move on.
> 2. **Classify** the divergence:
>     - **CODE-WRONG** — the spec correctly states intended behavior and the change violates it → BLOCKING finding; fix the code/test against intended behavior (write/adjust a regression TC first).
>     - **SPEC-STALE** — the change is the new intended behavior and the spec now documents the old/wrong behavior → update the spec FIRST via `/spec [mode=update]`, then sync `/spec [mode=tests]` + `/spec [mode=sync]`.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — intended behavior is unclear → `AskUserQuestion` (or the canonical spec owner) before editing either side.
>     - **SPEC-SILENT** — the code correctly enforces an invariant/behavior that NO canonical spec artifact (§3 AC, §4 BR, §5 invariant, §8 TC) states → not drift but an UNWRITTEN rule discovered by review. ENRICH the spec via the **Invariant Harvest** pass (`/spec [mode=sync] direction=harvest` → `spec/references/sync.md`): prove it is always-true (≥2 enforcement points or a rejecting guard), express it as a universally-quantified property, then add the rule to §4 (or §3/§5) AND a §8 TC via `/spec [update]` + `/spec [mode=tests]` and add the guarding test. A discovered invariant left only in code (or only in tests) is INCOMPLETE — this is the highest-value capture (the rule nobody wrote down).
> 3. **Never normalize drift just because code/tests are green** — green can encode the drift itself. Reconcile to canonical intent, never to whichever side currently passes.
>
> A behavior-changing review/implementation that leaves a spec divergence unadjudicated is INCOMPLETE; an unwritten-but-enforced invariant left uncaptured (no §4/§8 entry) is equally INCOMPLETE.

## SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine _who is at fault — the source code or the test code_. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `/debug-investigate` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the spec AND the source.** If a governing Feature Spec covers the behavior (e.g. `docs/specs/**` — §3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs), it is the tiebreaker for _intended_ behavior — compare BOTH the production source and the failing test against it. With no spec, the documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract is the reference. Decide from this evidence whether the SOURCE is wrong or the TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure or external state prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics and stop mutation until the environment is healthy.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no spec covers the behavior, the spec is silent, or the spec is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and `AskUserQuestion` (or consult the canonical spec owner) before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.
>
> Reconcile to intended behavior, never to whichever side currently passes — green can encode the very bug.

## SYNC:spec-loop-discipline

<!-- Canonical home of the Spec-Loop Discipline. Tailored instances live in: the 9 `workflow-*` injectContext blocks (`.claude/workflows.json`) and the code-mutating / review skills (e.g. `plan-execute`, `fix`, `prove-fix`, `spec`, `integration-test`, review skills). Those instances are TAILORED to each consumer's job, not verbatim copies, so they are NOT `<!-- SYNC:spec-loop-discipline -->`-marked. Edit this canonical first, then propagate the tailored wording. -->

> **Spec-Loop Discipline (spec→code→tests→review→re-review).** When changing or reviewing behavior-bearing code, specs, or tests, enforce the loop:
>
> 1. **Properties, not just examples** — every [HARD] business rule (§4) and §5 entity invariant is captured as a universally-quantified property ("for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds") plus a boundary counter-case, not only example scenarios.
> 2. **Hard-to-fake tests** — back each property with a property/metamorphic test; the test-quality bar for changed core logic is the MUTATION-SCORE gate (a surviving mutant on a changed line = a missing invariant → write the killing test), NOT line-coverage %.
> 3. **Dual feedback** — every behavior-changing finding feeds BOTH the spec AND the tests (Dual-Feedback Ledger: a blank Spec-feedback OR Test-feedback cell = INCOMPLETE), never a code-only change.
> 4. **Re-review to zero** — review the whole package (spec + tests + code, not just the diff); when a cycle discovers an unwritten-but-enforced rule (SPEC-SILENT), capture it into §3/§4/§8 AND its guarding test, then RE-REVIEW the package against the enriched spec — enrichment is a forced loop, not a terminal write. The loop ends only when a full pass adds no new spec content and surfaces no new gap or hidden rule; each cycle enriches the spec.

## SYNC:sub-agent-selection

> **Sub-Agent Selection** — Full routing contract: `.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`
> **Rule:** Route specialized domains (architecture, security, performance, DB, E2E, integration-test, git) to the matching specialist agent (see guide above) — NEVER use `code-reviewer` for these. — why: `code-reviewer` lacks each domain's checklist, so specialized issues slip through.

## SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol

> **Sequential Thinking Protocol** — Structured multi-step reasoning for complex/ambiguous work. Use when planning, reviewing, debugging, or refining ideas where one-shot reasoning is unsafe.
>
> **Trigger when:** complex problem decomposition · adaptive plans needing revision · analysis with course correction · unclear/emerging scope · multi-step solutions · hypothesis-driven debugging · cross-cutting trade-off evaluation.
>
> **Format (explicit mode — visible thought trail):**
>
> 1. `Thought N/M: [aspect]` — one aspect per thought, state assumptions/uncertainty
> 2. `Thought N/M [REVISION of Thought K]: ...` — when prior reasoning invalidated; state Original / Why revised / Impact
> 3. `Thought N/M [BRANCH A from Thought K]: ...` — explore alternative; converge with decision rationale
> 4. `Thought N/M [HYPOTHESIS]: ...` then `[VERIFICATION]: ...` — test before acting
> 5. `Thought N/N [FINAL]` — only when verified, all critical aspects addressed, confidence >80%
>
> **Mandatory closers:** Confidence % stated · Assumptions listed · Open questions surfaced · Next action concrete.
>
> **Stop conditions:** confidence <80% on any critical decision → escalate via AskUserQuestion · ≥3 revisions on same thought → re-frame the problem · branch count >3 → split into sub-task.
>
> **Implicit mode:** apply methodology internally without visible markers when adding markers would clutter the response (routine work where reasoning aids accuracy).
>
> **Deep-dive:** see `/sequential-thinking` skill (`.claude/skills/sequential-thinking/SKILL.md`) for worked examples (API design, debugging, architecture), advanced techniques (spiral refinement, hypothesis testing, convergence), and meta-strategies (uncertainty handling, revision cascades).

## SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop

> **Goal Contract Satisfaction Loop** — Persist the user goal in an external file, execute against it, and loop review/fix until every saved required criterion passes or a blocker escalates. Bounded closed loop — NEVER open-ended autonomous exploration.
>
> 1. **Resolve the active goal** (in order): active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create a new Goal Contract from the current user request (template: `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`).
> 2. **Required sections:** Original Request, Purpose, Success Criteria (checkboxes; mark required vs optional), Constraints, Evidence Required, Iteration Log, Goal Satisfaction matrix.
> 3. **Before work:** read the active goal and map planned work to saved success criteria — execution serves the saved criteria, never chat memory alone.
> 4. **After execution/verification:** append an Iteration Log entry — result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output, report path), remaining gaps.
> 5. **Review gate:** emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix — `| Success Criterion | Evidence | Status |` with PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED. Overall PASS requires every required criterion PASS.
> 6. **Loop rule (retry):** required criterion FAIL → validate the gap is real → fix → re-review only the affected criteria. Stop cleanly when all required criteria PASS.
> 7. **Escalation rule (stop):** two consecutive iterations with no criterion progressing, or a blocker needing user input → mark the criterion BLOCKED with a user-facing reason and escalate. NEVER loop indefinitely.
> 8. **Skip rule:** tiny conversational tasks may skip the goal file ONLY with a recorded one-line reason. User-accepted gate skips are recorded in the goal file with reason and scope.
> 9. **Security:** NEVER store secrets, tokens, credentials, or private customer data in goal files — store evidence references and redact sensitive values.
>
> **Blocked until:** active goal resolved (or skip reason recorded) · saved success criteria read before edits · iteration evidence appended after execution · Goal Satisfaction matrix emitted before any PASS verdict.

## SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

## SYNC:ui-intent-layer

> **[BLOCKING] Capture a tech-agnostic UI/UX intent layer in every UI-bearing spec — a reader must be able to visualize how the feature works without naming any technology.** When the feature has a user interface, the spec MUST ATTENTION carry an interaction-surface section so the application — not just its API — can be rebuilt on any stack:
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`).
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record that companion's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that reason explicitly in the section.

## SYNC:ui-intent-layer:full

> **[BLOCKING] The interaction-surface (UI/UX intent) layer — full authoring + maintenance contract.** A behavior-only spec reconstructs an API, not an application. For true spec-driven rebuild ("recreate the app on any stack, or build an MVP demo"), a UI-bearing spec MUST ATTENTION also capture the stack-agnostic information architecture and interaction model. Author and KEEP IN SYNC:
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — every view/screen named by its UX ROLE and purpose, plus the information each presents and the primary actions it offers. Group related views into the flows they serve. Describe roles and information, never implementation names.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — the directed connections between views: entry points (how a user arrives), in-feature transitions (which action leads where), and exits. Include how this surface attaches to adjacent existing features so the new surface fits the current system rather than floating apart.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — per view, the distinct states a user can perceive: empty / first-run, loading / pending, populated, partial, error / recovery, success / confirmation, and permission- or role-gated variants. State each as a user-observable condition, not a rendering mechanism.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the ordered action path from the user's intent to the observable outcome, with branch points for the key states above. Cross-reference every step to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-` user stories, `OP-` operations, `BR-` business rules) so the UI layer stays traceable to behavior — never a parallel, drifting narrative.
> 5. **Companion design artifact coupling** — deep visual fidelity (layout grids, spacing, color/typography tokens, exact pixel/responsive detail) does NOT belong in the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record the companion artifact's path in the spec frontmatter so a reader reaches it in one hop, and so the spec remains the navigable hub of the feature.
> 6. **Maintenance contract** — when behavior changes (new story, changed operation, altered rule), update the affected View Inventory entries, Navigation Map edges, observable States, and interaction flows in the same change. An audit that finds behavior without a corresponding interaction-surface entry (or vice versa) reports the layer as stale.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** every line names ZERO frameworks, libraries, routes/URLs, CSS, selectors, or component-class names. Use only UX roles, the information shown, observable states, and action flows. Any technology-specific detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never in the spec prose. A spec that names a stack here has broken its tech-free rebuild contract.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is genuinely backend-only (no user-facing surface) — and then state that reason explicitly in the section so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

## SYNC:ui-intent-layer:reminder

- **MANDATORY** For UI-bearing specs, author/maintain the tech-agnostic interaction-surface layer (View Inventory + Navigation Map + observable UI States + per-story `US-/OP-/BR-`-traced flow); keep deep visual fidelity in the linked `design-spec`/mockup recorded in frontmatter; name ZERO frameworks/routes/CSS/component classes; skip ONLY for backend-only features with a stated reason.
