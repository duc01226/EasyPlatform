> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:

> - **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> - **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> - **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> - **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> - **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> - **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> - **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> - **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> - **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> - **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Build comprehensive marketing strategy with positioning, channels, messaging, campaigns, budget, and KPIs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Load market analysis** — Read market-analysis output
2. **Define positioning** — Value proposition, differentiation
3. **Plan channels** — Strategy with budget allocation + ROI
4. **Craft messaging** — Tagline, key messages, proof points
5. **Build campaign roadmap** — Phases with timeline and KPIs
6. **Risk assessment** — Marketing risks with mitigation

**Key Rules:**

- Positioning MUST ATTENTION reference competitive analysis
- Every channel: purpose, budget %, expected ROI, priority
- KPIs must be specific, measurable, time-bound

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Strategy Builder

## Step 1: Load Market Analysis

Read the market analysis output (from market-analysis skill or inline).
Extract: competitor landscape, target segments, SWOT, market size.

## Step 2: Positioning

Based on competitive analysis:

- **Value proposition** — What unique value do we offer?
- **Differentiation** — How are we different from competitor X, Y, Z?
- **Brand voice** — Tone, personality, communication style

## Step 3: Channel Strategy

For each channel:

| Channel   | Purpose                           | Budget % | Expected ROI | Priority |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| {channel} | {awareness/acquisition/retention} | {%}      | {X:1}        | P0/P1/P2 |

Total budget % must equal 100%.

## Step 4: Messaging Framework

- **Tagline** — One memorable line
- **Key messages** (3-5 pillars) — Core themes
- **Proof points** — Evidence supporting each message
- **Elevator pitch** — 30-second version

## Step 5: Campaign Roadmap

| Phase  | Timeline | Objective   | Tactics | KPIs      | Budget |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Launch | M1-M3    | Awareness   | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |
| Growth | M4-M6    | Acquisition | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |
| Scale  | M7-M12   | Retention   | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |

## Step 6: Risk Assessment

| Risk   | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| {risk} | H/M/L      | H/M/L  | {strategy} |

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
    <!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply critical thinking — every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact.
    <!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — holistic-first debugging, fix at responsible layer, surface ambiguity before coding, re-read files after compaction.
    <!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
