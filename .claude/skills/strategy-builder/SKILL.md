## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Build comprehensive marketing strategy with positioning, channels, messaging, campaigns, budget, and KPIs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Load market analysis** — Read market-analysis output
2. **Define positioning** — Value proposition, differentiation
3. **Plan channels** — Strategy with budget allocation + ROI
4. **Craft messaging** — Tagline, key messages, proof points
5. **Build campaign roadmap** — Phases with timeline and KPIs
6. **Risk assessment** — Marketing risks with mitigation

**Key Rules:**

- Positioning MUST ATTENTION reference competitive analysis
- Every channel: purpose, budget %, expected ROI, priority
- KPIs must be specific, measurable, time-bound

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Strategy Builder

## Step 1: Load Market Analysis

Read the market analysis output (from market-analysis skill or inline).
Extract: competitor landscape, target segments, SWOT, market size.

## Step 2: Positioning

Based on competitive analysis:

- **Value proposition** — What unique value do we offer?
- **Differentiation** — How are we different from competitor X, Y, Z?
- **Brand voice** — Tone, personality, communication style

## Step 3: Channel Strategy

For each channel:

| Channel   | Purpose                           | Budget % | Expected ROI | Priority |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| {channel} | {awareness/acquisition/retention} | {%}      | {X:1}        | P0/P1/P2 |

Total budget % must equal 100%.

## Step 4: Messaging Framework

- **Tagline** — One memorable line
- **Key messages** (3-5 pillars) — Core themes
- **Proof points** — Evidence supporting each message
- **Elevator pitch** — 30-second version

## Step 5: Campaign Roadmap

| Phase  | Timeline | Objective   | Tactics | KPIs      | Budget |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Launch | M1-M3    | Awareness   | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |
| Growth | M4-M6    | Acquisition | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |
| Scale  | M7-M12   | Retention   | {list}  | {metrics} | {$}    |

## Step 6: Risk Assessment

| Risk   | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| {risk} | H/M/L      | H/M/L  | {strategy} |

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION traced `file:line` proof per claim; confidence >80% to act; NEVER guess.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
