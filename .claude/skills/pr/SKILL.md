> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create a pull request with standardized format (summary, test plan, changes list).

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyze** -- Review all commits and changes on the branch
2. **Draft** -- Create PR title (<70 chars) and body with summary + test plan
3. **Create** -- Push branch and create PR via `gh pr create`

**Key Rules:**
- PR title under 70 characters; use body for details
- Include summary bullets and test plan checklist
- Push to remote with `-u` flag before creating PR
