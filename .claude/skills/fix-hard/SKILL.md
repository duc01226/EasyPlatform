> 2. **Identify the invariant owner** — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? That layer is responsible. Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant — not the highest layer that consumes it.
> 3. **One fix, maximum protection** — Ask: "If I fix here, does it protect ALL downstream consumers with ONE change?" If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
> 4. **Verify no bypass paths** — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for: direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Full data flow traced (origin → crash) `- [ ]` Invariant owner identified with `file:line` evidence `- [ ]` All access sites audited (grep count) `- [ ]` Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers)

> **Anti-patterns (REJECT these):**
>
> - "Fix it where it crashes" — Crash site ≠ cause site. Trace upstream.
> - "Add defensive checks at every consumer" — Scattered defense = wrong layer. One authoritative fix > many scattered guards.
> - "Both fix is safer" — Pick ONE authoritative layer. Redundant checks across layers send mixed signals about who owns the invariant.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Systematically diagnose and fix complex bugs using parallel subagent investigation.

**Workflow:**

1. **Scout** — Use scout/researcher subagents to explore the issue in parallel
2. **Diagnose** — Trace root cause through code paths with evidence
3. **Plan** — Create fix plan with impact analysis
4. **Fix** — Implement and verify the fix

**Key Rules:**

- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use subagents for parallel investigation of multiple hypotheses
- Always create a plan before implementing complex fixes

<!-- SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 3. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 4. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it
> 5. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 6. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step.

<!-- /SYNC:root-cause-debugging -->

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

- Do NOT assume the first hypothesis is correct — verify with actual code traces
- Every root cause claim must include `file:line` evidence
- If you cannot prove a root cause with a code trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed"
- Question assumptions: "Is this really the cause?" → trace the actual execution path
- Challenge completeness: "Are there other contributing factors?" → check related code paths
- No "should fix it" without proof — verify the fix addresses the traced root cause

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

**Ultrathink** to plan & start fixing these issues follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## Workflow:

If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.

### Fullfill the request

**Question Everything**: Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask probing questions to fully understand the user's request, constraints, and true objectives. Don't assume - clarify until you're 100% certain.

- If you have any questions, use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask the user to clarify them.
- Ask 1 question at a time, wait for the user to answer before moving to the next question.
- If you don't have any questions, start the next step.

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause + plan creation, MUST ATTENTION present findings + proposed fix plan to user via `AskUserQuestion` and get explicit approval BEFORE any code changes. No silent fixes.

### Fix the issue

Use `sequential-thinking` skill to break complex problems into sequential thought steps.
Use `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
Analyze the skills catalog and activate other skills that are needed for the task during the process.

1. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
   1.5. Write investigation results to `.ai/workspace/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning fix.
2. Use `researcher` subagent to research quickly about the root causes on the internet (if needed) and report back to main agent.
3. Use `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan based on the reports, then report back to main agent.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → `AskUserQuestion` → wait for user approval.**
5. Then use `/code` SlashCommand to implement the plan step by step.
6. Final Report:

- Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.
- Ask the user if they want to commit and push to git repository, if yes, use `git-manager` subagent to commit and push to git repository.

* **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
* **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**REMEMBER**:

- You can always generate images with `ai-multimodal` skills on the fly for visual assets.
- You always read and analyze the generated assets with `ai-multimodal` skills to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use `media-processing` skill as needed.

- **After fixing, MUST ATTENTION run `/prove-fix`** — build code proof traces per change with confidence scores. Never skip.

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (fix applied). This ensures prove-fix, review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/prove-fix"** — Prove fix correctness with code traces
- **"/test"** — Run tests to verify fix
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** STOP after 3 failed fix attempts — report outcomes, ask user before #4
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:
    <!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
    <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend.
    <!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include `story_points` and `complexity` in plan frontmatter. SP > 8 = split.
  <!-- /SYNC:estimation-framework:reminder -->
  <!-- SYNC:fix-layer-accountability:reminder -->
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace full data flow and fix at the owning layer, not the crash site. Audit all access sites before adding `?.`.
