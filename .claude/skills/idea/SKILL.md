---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Capture raw product ideas as structured backlog artifacts with project module context.

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** Plan ToDo Task to READ the following project-specific reference doc:
>
> - `project-structure-reference.md` -- project patterns and structure
>
> If file not found, search for: project documentation, coding standards, architecture docs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Gather Info** — Ask about the idea, problem, value, and target users
2. **Generate Artifact** — Create idea file with ID (IDEA-YYMMDD-NNN) and draft status
3. **Detect Module** — Auto-match to project module, load feature context from docs
4. **Validate** — Interview user to confirm problem statement, scope, stakeholders
5. **Suggest Next** — Point to `/refine` for PBI creation

**Key Rules:**

- Output to `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`

## Greenfield Mode

> **Auto-detected:** If no existing codebase is found (no code directories like `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `packages/`, etc., no manifest files like `package.json`/`*.sln`/`go.mod`, no populated `project-config.json`), this skill switches to greenfield mode automatically. Planning artifacts (docs/, plans/, .claude/) don't count — the project must have actual code directories with content.

**When greenfield is detected:**

1. Skip module auto-detection from existing project (no modules exist yet)
2. Skip "MUST READ project-structure-reference.md" (won't exist)
3. Focus on broader problem-space capture: market gap, competitors, differentiation
4. Output tech-agnostic problem statement (no existing tech stack to reference)
5. Enable web research for market/competitor context (WebSearch)
6. Increase AskUserQuestion frequency — capture vision, constraints, team profile, scale expectations
7. **[CRITICAL] DO NOT ask about tech stack during idea capture.** Tech stack is a research-driven decision that comes AFTER full business analysis (business-evaluation phase). If the user volunteers a tech stack preference, acknowledge it but still defer final decision to the tech stack research phase where it will be properly evaluated with pros/cons, market analysis, and team-fit assessment.

- Validation step is mandatory, not optional
- Auto-detect module silently; only prompt when ambiguous
- MUST include rough `t_shirt_size` (XS/S/M/L/XL) in idea artifact for early sizing

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Idea Capture

Capture raw ideas as structured artifacts for backlog consideration.

## When to Use

- User has new feature concept
- Stakeholder request needs documentation
- Quick capture without full refinement

## Quick Reference

### Workflow

1. Activate `product-owner` skill
2. Gather idea details (problem, value, scope, target users)
3. Generate artifact with ID and draft status
4. Detect related project module (dynamic discovery)
5. Load feature context from `docs/business-features/`
6. Save artifact to `team-artifacts/ideas/`
7. **Validate idea** (MANDATORY) - Interview user to confirm problem statement, scope, and stakeholders
8. Suggest next: `/refine {idea-file}`

### Output

- **Path:** `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`
- **ID Pattern:** `IDEA-{YYMMDD}-{NNN}` (sequential)

### Related

- **Role Skill:** `product-owner`
- **Command:** `/idea`
- **Next Step:** `/refine`

## Template

See: `.claude/docs/team-artifacts/templates/idea-template.md`

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

- If no title provided, ask: "What's the idea in one sentence?"
- Ask: "What problem does this solve?"
- Ask: "Who benefits from this?"
- Ask: "Any initial scope thoughts?"

### Step 2: Generate Artifact

- Create idea file using template
- Generate ID: `IDEA-{YYMMDD}-{NNN}` (sequential)
- Set status: `draft`

### Step 3: Capture Details

- Document problem statement
- List expected value
- Identify target users

### Step 4: Detect Project Module

**Dynamic Discovery:**

1. Run: `Glob("docs/business-features/*/README.md")`
2. Extract module names from paths (e.g., ServiceB, ServiceA, SupportingServices)
3. Match idea keywords against module keywords (detect module from docs/business-features/ directory names)

**Detection Approach (silent auto-detect):**

- Auto-detect without showing confidence levels
- Only prompt when ambiguous or no clear match
- Multi-module: Load ALL detected modules

**If module detected:**

1. Read `docs/business-features/{module}/README.md` (first 200 lines for overview)
2. Extract feature list from Quick Navigation section
3. Add to idea frontmatter:
    - `module: {detected_module}`
    - `related_features: [Feature1, Feature2]`

**If ambiguous/not detected:**

- Run Glob to get current module list
- Prompt: "Which project module?" + list Glob results + "Cross-cutting/Infrastructure"

**Multi-module detection:**

- If 2+ modules detected, load ALL modules (no primary prompt)
- Add all to `related_features` list

### Step 5: Load Feature Context

Once module detected:

1. Read module README overview section (~2K tokens)
2. Identify closest matching feature(s) from feature list
3. Read corresponding feature doc or `.ai.md` file (3-5K tokens)
4. Extract:
    - Related entities
    - Existing business rules (BR-{MOD}-XXX)
    - Test case patterns (TC-{MOD}-XXX)

**Token Budget:** Target 8-12K tokens total for feature context.

### Step 6: Save Artifact

- Path: `team-artifacts/ideas/{YYMMDD}-{role}-idea-{slug}.md`
- Role: Infer from context or ask
- Include domain context if detected

### Step 6.5: Idea Discovery Interview (MANDATORY)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to probe the idea with 3-5 structured questions. Each question MUST have 2-4 options with one marked "(Recommended)".

#### Question Categories (pick 3-5 based on idea type):

| Category        | Purpose                           | Example                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Problem Clarity | Distinguish problem from solution | "What problem does this solve?" with options |
| User Persona    | Identify primary user             | "Who benefits most?" with role options       |
| Scope           | MVP vs full vision                | "What's the smallest valuable version?"      |
| Testability     | Can we define done?               | "How would you verify this works?"           |
| Impact          | Business value sizing             | "How many users/processes does this affect?" |
| Constraints     | Known blockers                    | "Any technical/business constraints?"        |
| Scale           | Expected load and growth          | "How many users/transactions expected?"      |

> **Greenfield note:** In greenfield mode, do NOT include tech stack questions here. Focus on business problem, users, scale, and constraints. Tech stack is evaluated in a dedicated research phase later.

#### Testability Question (ALWAYS include):

"How would you verify this feature works correctly?"

- Options based on domain: manual test steps, automated test criteria, metric thresholds

Document all answers in the idea artifact under `## Discovery Interview`.

### Step 7: Suggest Next Step

After idea capture, suggest:

1. `/refine` — Refine into PBI (Recommended)
2. `/tdd-spec` — Jump straight to test spec creation
3. `/plan` — Start implementation planning

- Output: "Idea captured! To refine into a PBI, run: `/refine {filename}`"
- If domain module detected: "Module context from {module} will be used during refinement."

## Validation Step (MANDATORY)

After capturing the idea, validate with user. **This step is NOT optional.**

### Question Categories

| Category         | Example Question                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem**      | "Is the problem statement clear and user-focused?"    |
| **Value**        | "What's the expected business value or user benefit?" |
| **Scope**        | "Any scope boundaries to clarify now?"                |
| **Stakeholders** | "Who else should review this idea?"                   |

### Process

1. Generate 2-3 questions focused on problem clarity, scope, and stakeholders
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to interview with specific questions:
    - "Is the problem statement clear and user-focused?"
    - "Any scope boundaries to clarify now?"
    - "Who else should review this idea?"
3. Document in idea artifact under `## Validation Summary`
4. Update idea based on answers

### Validation Output Format

```markdown
## Validation Summary

**Validated:** {date}

### Confirmed

- {decision}: {user choice}

### Action Items

- [ ] {follow-up if any}
```

## Domain Context Output Format

When a project module is detected, include this section in the idea artifact:

```markdown
## Domain Context (Project Features)

### Module

{module_name}

### Related Features

- {Feature1} - [docs link]
- {Feature2} - [docs link]

### Domain Entities

- **Primary:** {Entity1}, {Entity2}
- **Related:** {Entity3}

### Existing Business Rules

- BR-{MOD}-XXX: {Brief description}
```

## UI Sketch Output Format

<!-- SYNC:ui-wireframe -->

> **UI Wireframe** — Process visual design input (Figma URLs, screenshots, wireframes) via appropriate tool BEFORE creating wireframes. Use box-drawing ASCII characters for spatial layout. Classify every component into exactly ONE tier: Common (cross-app reusable) / Domain-Shared (cross-domain) / Page (single-page). Duplicate UI code = wrong tier. Search existing component libraries before creating new (>=80% match = reuse). Detail level varies by skill (idea=rough, story=full decomposition).

<!-- /SYNC:ui-wireframe -->

When the idea involves UI changes, include this section in the idea artifact:

```markdown
## UI Sketch

### Layout

{Rough ASCII wireframe showing spatial arrangement — see UI wireframe protocol}

### Key Components

- **{Component}** — {purpose} _(tier: common | domain-shared | page/app)_
- **{Component}** — {purpose} _(tier: common | domain-shared | page/app)_
```

> Classify components per **Component Hierarchy** in `UI wireframe protocol` — search existing libs before proposing new components.
> If backend-only idea: `## UI Sketch` → `N/A — Backend-only change. No UI affected.`

## Example

```bash
/idea "Dark mode toggle for settings"
```

Creates: `team-artifacts/ideas/260119-po-idea-dark-mode-toggle.md`

```bash
/idea "Add goal progress tracking notification"
```

Creates with ServiceB context: `team-artifacts/ideas/260119-po-idea-goal-progress-notification.md`

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `idea-to-pbi` workflow** (Recommended) — idea → refine → refine-review → story → story-review → prioritize
> 2. **Execute `/idea` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/refine (Recommended)"** — Transform idea into actionable PBI
- **"/web-research"** — If idea needs market research first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
