## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger the E2E testing workflow — one parameterized entry covering all three E2E sources. `--source` selects the protocol; the sequence is identical for every source.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — read `--source={changes|recording|update-ui}`; classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply the source-specific protocol below with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /scout -> /e2e-test -> /test -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

## Source Dispatch (`--source`)

Resolve `--source` from the invocation. If omitted, infer from the request (recording file present → `recording`; UI/SCSS/HTML diff → `update-ui`; otherwise `changes`) and state the chosen source before proceeding.

| `--source`  | Use when                                                                 | When NOT to use                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `changes`   | Test specs or source code changed and E2E tests need to be synced.       | New recordings (`recording`), visual-only changes (`update-ui`).       |
| `recording` | A Chrome DevTools recording JSON exists and a Playwright test is wanted. | Updating existing tests, writing from scratch, running existing tests. |
| `update-ui` | UI changed and E2E screenshot baselines need updating.                   | Generating new tests, fixing test logic, non-visual changes.           |

All three sources run the same sequence: `/scout → /e2e-test → /test → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup`. The downstream `e2e-test` leaf is mode-aware and performs the per-source work; this wrapper only injects the matching protocol and triggers the workflow.

### `--source=changes` — E2E from Changes

```
E2E FROM CHANGES PROTOCOL:
1. Detect change type from git diff:
   - Test spec changes in feature docs -> Generate new test cases
   - Code changes -> Update existing test assertions
   - API changes -> Update test data and API mocks
2. Load affected test specifications (TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN})
3. Update or generate test implementations
4. Ensure traceability: each TC has corresponding test
5. Run tests to verify changes work
6. Report updated test coverage
```

### `--source=recording` — E2E from Recording

```
E2E FROM RECORDING PROTOCOL:
1. Validate recording file exists (JSON format)
2. Identify target app and feature from user context
3. Run convert-recording.ts to generate initial test file
4. Load test specifications from feature docs Section 8
5. Map TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} test cases to recording steps
6. Enhance generated code with project CSS conventions (from docs/project-config.json → workflowPatterns.cssMethodology)
7. Add screenshot assertions at key states
8. Generate Page Object if complex flow
9. Run test to verify it passes
10. Report generated files and any manual steps needed
```

### `--source=update-ui` — E2E Update UI

```
E2E UPDATE UI PROTOCOL:
1. Identify visual changes from git diff (SCSS, HTML, TS)
2. Map changed files to affected page objects
3. Find E2E specs using those page objects
4. Run affected tests to generate new screenshots
5. Update screenshot baselines with --update-snapshots
6. Visual review: diff old vs new baselines
7. Confirm changes are intentional with user
8. Report updated files and visual changes
```

**UNIVERSAL RULES (all sources):**

- Goal-Driven Execution: define success criteria before execution; loop until observable checks pass.
- Tests Verify Intent: when creating or reviewing specs/tests, name the protected business intent or invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.

Activate the `workflow-e2e` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-e2e` with the user's prompt as context and the resolved `--source` protocol above.

**Steps:** /scout → /e2e-test → /test → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /scout -> /e2e-test -> /test -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
