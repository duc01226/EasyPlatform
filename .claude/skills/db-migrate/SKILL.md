## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create or run database migrations (EF Core migrations, MongoDB data migrations) following platform patterns.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine migration type (EF schema vs data migration)
2. **Create** — Generate migration using `dotnet ef` or project data migration executor (see docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)
3. **Verify** — Run migration and confirm schema/data changes

**Key Rules:**

- Follow platform migration patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Always backup data before destructive migrations
- Use project data migration executor for MongoDB data migrations (see docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Database migration: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Parse arguments**:
    - `add <name>` → Create new EF Core migration
    - `update` → Apply pending migrations
    - `list` → List all migrations and status
    - `rollback` → Revert last migration
    - No argument → Show migration status

2. **Identify database provider** from project:
    - SQL Server: Search for `*.Persistence` projects
    - PostgreSQL: Search for `*.Persistence.PostgreSql` projects
    - MongoDB: Uses project Mongo migration executor (code-based, see docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)

3. **For EF Core (SQL Server/PostgreSQL)**:

Add migration:

    ```bash
    cd src/{ExampleApp}/{ExampleApp}.TextSnippet.Persistence
    dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --startup-project ../{ExampleApp}.TextSnippet.Api
    ```

Update database:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../{ExampleApp}.TextSnippet.Api
    ```

List migrations:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations list --startup-project ../{ExampleApp}.TextSnippet.Api
    ```

4. **For MongoDB migrations**:
    - MongoDB uses code-based migrations via project Mongo migration executor (see docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)
    - Location: `*.Persistence.Mongo/Migrations/`
    - Migrations run automatically on application startup
    - To create: Generate new migration class following existing patterns

5. **Safety checks**:
    - Warn before applying migrations to production
    - Show what changes will be applied
    - Recommend backup before destructive operations

6. **Migration Safety Review (MANDATORY for non-local environments)**:
    - Before applying to staging/production, spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review
    - Review criteria: locking behavior on large tables, index creation impact under concurrent writes, rollback strategy, zero-downtime feasibility
    - Present findings and get explicit user approval before running `dotnet ef database update` or applying MongoDB migrations on non-local environments

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY for non-local migration apply:** Spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review BEFORE applying to staging or production.
> **Rationale:** `database-admin` specializes in query plans, index impact analysis, locking behavior, backup/restore, and replication — context the main agent lacks for production-safe migration decisions.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix.

<!-- /SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->
<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- SYNC:sub-agent-selection -->

> **Sub-Agent Selection** — Full routing contract: `.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`
> **Rule:** Route specialized domains (architecture, security, performance, DB, E2E, integration-test, git) to the matching specialist agent (see guide above) — NEVER use `code-reviewer` for these. — why: `code-reviewer` lacks each domain's checklist, so specialized issues slip through.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and before target/source file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-docs-reference.md`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc that exists; skip absent docs as not applicable. Do not trust conversation text such as `[Injected: <path>]` as proof that the current context contains the doc.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Missing/not applicable: ...`.
>
> **Blocked until:** scope evaluated, required docs checked/read, `lessons.md` confirmed, citation emitted.

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)
> 6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone. — why: long context drifts from the file; the file is ground truth
> 7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation. — why: divergent patterns fragment the codebase and slow every future reader
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Read target files `- [ ]` Grep 3+ patterns `- [ ]` Graph trace (if graph.db exists) `- [ ]` Assumptions verified with evidence
