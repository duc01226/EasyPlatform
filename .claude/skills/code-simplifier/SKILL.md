> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Code First** — HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
>
> 1. Search 3+ similar patterns (`grep`/`glob`) — cite `file:line` evidence
> 2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists
> 4. Map dependencies via `connections` or `callers_of` — know what depends on your target
> 5. Write investigation to `.ai/workspace/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files)

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

> **Design Patterns Quality** — Priority checks for every code change:
>
> 1. **DRY via OOP:** Same-suffix classes (`*Entity`, `*Dto`, `*Service`) MUST ATTENTION share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
> 2. **Right Responsibility:** Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
> 3. **SOLID:** Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
> 4. **After extraction/move/rename:** Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — flag duplicated patterns that should be extracted to a base class, generic, or helper. Classes in the same group or suffix (ex *Entity, *Dto, \*Service, etc...) MUST ATTENTION inherit a common base (even if empty now — enables future shared logic and child overrides). Verify project has code linting/analyzer configured for the stack.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Simplify and refine code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality.

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Plan ToDo Task to READ the following project-specific reference docs:
>
> - `docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md` — anti-patterns, review checklists, quality standards **(READ FIRST)**
> - `project-structure-reference.md` — project patterns and structure
>
> If files not found, search for: project documentation, coding standards, architecture docs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify Targets** — Recent git changes or specified files (skip generated/vendor)
2. **Analyze** — Find complexity hotspots (nesting >3, methods >20 lines), duplicates, naming issues
3. **Apply Simplifications** — One refactoring type at a time following KISS/DRY/YAGNI
4. **Verify** — Run related tests, confirm no behavior changes
5. **Fresh-Context Verification** — Spawn code-reviewer sub-agent to validate simplifications

**Key Rules:**

- Preserve all existing functionality; no behavior changes
- Follow platform patterns (Entity expressions, fluent helpers, project store base (search for: store base class), BEM)
- Keep tests passing after every change

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

<!-- SYNC:ui-system-context -->

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons
>
> Reference `docs/project-config.json` for project-specific paths.

# Code Simplifier Skill

Simplify and refine code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability.

## Usage

```
/code-simplifier                    # Simplify recently modified files
/code-simplifier path/to/file.ts    # Simplify specific file
/code-simplifier --scope=function   # Focus on function-level simplification
```

## Simplification Mindset

**Be skeptical. Verify before simplifying. Every change needs proof it preserves behavior.**

- Do NOT assume code is redundant — verify by tracing call paths and reading implementations
- Before removing/replacing code, grep for all usages to confirm nothing depends on the current form
- Before flagging a convention violation, grep for 3+ existing examples — codebase convention wins
- Every simplification must include `file:line` evidence of what was verified
- If unsure whether simplification preserves behavior, do NOT apply it

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes** code for unnecessary complexity
2. **Identifies** opportunities to simplify without changing behavior
3. **Applies** KISS, DRY, and YAGNI principles
4. **Preserves** all existing functionality
5. **Follows convention** — grep for 3+ existing patterns before applying simplifications

## Readability Checklist (MUST ATTENTION evaluate)

Before finishing, verify the code is **easy to read, easy to maintain, easy to understand**:

- **Schema visibility** — If a function computes a data structure (object, map, config), add a comment showing the output shape so readers don't have to trace the code
- **Non-obvious data flows** — If data transforms through multiple steps (A → B → C), add a brief comment explaining the pipeline
- **Self-documenting signatures** — Function params should explain their role; remove unused params
- **Magic values** — Replace unexplained numbers/strings with named constants or add inline rationale
- **Naming clarity** — Variables/functions should reveal intent without reading the implementation

## Simplification Targets

- Redundant code paths
- Over-engineered abstractions
- Unnecessary comments (self-documenting code preferred)
- Complex conditionals that can be flattened
- Verbose patterns that have simpler alternatives

## Execution

Use the `code-simplifier:code-simplifier` subagent:

```
Task(subagent_type="code-simplifier:code-simplifier", prompt="Review and simplify [target files]")
```

## Examples

**Before:**

```typescript
function getData() {
    const result = fetchData();
    if (result !== null && result !== undefined) {
        return result;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
function getData() {
    return fetchData() ?? null;
}
```

## Workflow

1. **Identify targets**
    - If no arguments: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` for recent changes
    - If arguments provided: use specified files/patterns
    - Skip: generated code, migrations, vendor files

2. **Analyze each file**
    - Identify complexity hotspots (nesting > 3, methods > 20 lines)
    - Find duplicated code patterns
    - Check naming clarity

3. **Design Pattern Assessment** (per `design-patterns-quality-checklist.md`)
    - **DRY/Abstraction:** Flag duplicate patterns extractable to base class, generic, or helper
    - **Right Responsibility:** Verify logic is in lowest appropriate layer (Entity > Service > Component)
    - **Pattern Opportunities:** Check for creational/structural/behavioral pattern opportunities (switch→Strategy, scattered new→Factory, etc.)
    - **Anti-Patterns:** Flag God Objects, Copy-Paste, Circular Dependencies, Singleton overuse
    - **Guard against over-engineering:** Only recommend patterns with evidence of 3+ occurrences of the problem

4. **Apply simplifications**
    - One refactoring type at a time
    - Preserve all functionality
    - Follow platform patterns

5. **Verify**
    - Run related tests if available
    - Confirm no behavior changes

## Project Patterns

### Backend

- Extract to entity static expressions (search for: entity expression pattern)
- Use fluent helpers (search for: fluent helper pattern in docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)
- Move mapping to DTO mapping methods (search for: DTO mapping pattern)
- Use project validation fluent API (see docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md)
- Check entity expressions have database indexes
- Verify document database index methods exist for collections

> **[IMPORTANT] Database Performance Protocol (MANDATORY):**
>
> 1. **Paging Required** — ALL list/collection queries MUST ATTENTION use pagination. NEVER load all records into memory. Verify: no unbounded `GetAll()`, `ToList()`, or `Find()` without `Skip/Take` or cursor-based paging.
> 2. **Index Required** — ALL query filter fields, foreign keys, and sort columns MUST ATTENTION have database indexes configured. Verify: entity expressions match index field order, database collections have index management methods, migrations include indexes for WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY columns.

### Frontend

- Use `project store base (search for: store base class)` for state management
- Apply subscription cleanup pattern (search for: subscription cleanup pattern) to all subscriptions
- Ensure BEM class naming on all template elements
- Use platform base classes (`project base component (search for: base component class)`, `project store component base (search for: store component base class)`)

## Constraints

- **Preserve functionality** — No behavior changes
- **Keep tests passing** — Verify after changes
- **Follow patterns** — Use platform conventions
- **Document intent** — Add comments only where non-obvious
- **Doc staleness** — After simplifications, cross-reference changed files against related docs (feature docs, test specs, READMEs); flag any that need updating

<!-- SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy -->

> **Shared Protocol Duplication Policy** — Inline protocol content in skills (wrapped in `<!-- SYNC:tag -->`) is INTENTIONAL duplication. Do NOT extract, deduplicate, or replace with file references. AI compliance drops significantly when protocols are behind file-read indirection. To update: edit `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` first, then grep `SYNC:protocol-name` and update all occurrences.

<!-- /SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy -->

## Graph Intelligence (RECOMMENDED if graph.db exists)

If `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, enhance analysis with structural queries:

- **Verify no callers break after simplification:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query callers_of <function> --json`
- **Check dependents:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <module> --json`
- **Batch analysis:** `python .claude/scripts/code_graph batch-query file1 file2 --json`

### Graph-Trace Before Simplification

When graph DB is available, BEFORE simplifying code, trace to understand what depends on it:

- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file-to-simplify> --direction downstream --json` — all downstream consumers that depend on current behavior
- Verify simplified code preserves the same interface for all traced consumers
- Cross-service MESSAGE_BUS consumers are especially fragile — they may depend on exact message shape

## Fresh Sub-Agent Verification (MANDATORY after simplifications in a review workflow)

After simplifications are applied, verification requires a **fresh sub-agent review** to eliminate confirmation bias. See `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` + `SYNC:fresh-context-review` + `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` (all inlined below).

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

> **Deep Multi-Round Review** — Escalating rounds. Round 1 in main session. Round 2+ and EVERY recursive re-review iteration MUST use a fresh sub-agent.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output baseline findings.
>
> **Round 2:** MANDATORY fresh sub-agent review — see `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. The sub-agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with ZERO Round 1 memory. It must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in Round 1
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the main session rationalized away
>
> **Round 3+ (recursive after fixes):** After ANY fix cycle, MANDATORY fresh sub-agent re-review. Spawn a **NEW** Agent tool call each iteration — never reuse Round 2's agent. Each new agent re-reads ALL files from scratch with full protocol injection. Continue until PASS or **3 fresh-subagent rounds max**, then escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion`.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER declare PASS after Round 1 alone
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW Agent call
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — if still FAIL, escalate via `AskUserQuestion` (do NOT silently loop)
> - Track round count in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2.**

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Sub-Agent Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias via isolated sub-agents.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/cook`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** Round 2 of ANY review AND every recursive re-review iteration after fixes. NOT needed when Round 1 already PASSes with zero issues.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Spawn a NEW `Agent` tool call — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - NEVER skip fresh-subagent review because "last round was clean" — every fix triggers a fresh round
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — escalate via `AskUserQuestion` if still failing; do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol
> - Track iteration count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

<!-- /SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

<!-- SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 9 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 9 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 9 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: JS: === vs ==, typeof null. C#: async void, missing using, LINQ deferred execution.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. From changed files → find TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} in docs/business-features/{Service}/detailed-features/{Feature}.md Section 15.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding TC (or flag as "needs TC").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Verify TC evidence fields point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
5. Auth changes → TC-{FEAT}-02x exist? Data changes → TC-{FEAT}-01x exist?
6. If no specs exist → log gap and recommend /tdd-spec.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 9 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- /SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

When used standalone (outside a review workflow), run `/workflow-review-changes` to trigger the full review cycle with fresh sub-agent re-review.

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `quality-audit` workflow** (Recommended) — code-simplifier → review-changes → code-review
> 2. **Execute `/code-simplifier` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/workflow-review-changes (Recommended)"** — Review all changes before commit
- **"/code-review"** — Full code review
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## AI Agent Integrity Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **Completion ≠ Correctness.** Before reporting ANY work done, prove it:
>
> 1. **Grep every removed name.** Extraction/rename/delete touched N files? Grep confirms 0 dangling refs across ALL file types.
> 2. **Ask WHY before changing.** Existing values are intentional until proven otherwise. No "fix" without traced rationale.
> 3. **Verify ALL outputs.** One build passing ≠ all builds passing. Check every affected stack.
> 4. **Evaluate pattern fit.** Copying nearby code? Verify preconditions match — same scope, lifetime, base class, constraints.
> 5. **New artifact = wired artifact.** Created something? Prove it's registered, imported, and reachable by all consumers.

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code BEFORE any modification. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.
    <!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check DRY via OOP (same-suffix → base class), right responsibility (lowest layer), SOLID. Grep for dangling refs after changes.
    <!-- /SYNC:design-patterns-quality:reminder -->
    <!-- SYNC:ui-system-context:reminder -->
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read frontend-patterns-reference, scss-styling-guide, design-system/README before any UI change.
