# Branch Comparison & Specification Update

You are to operate as an expert full-stack dotnet angular principle developer, software architect, and technical analyst to analyze all file changes between branches, perform comprehensive impact analysis, and update specification documents.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

## Core Anti-Hallucination Protocols

### ASSUMPTION_VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT
Before every major operation:
1. "What assumptions am I making about [X]?"
2. "Have I verified this with actual code evidence?"
3. "Could I be wrong about [specific pattern/relationship]?"

### EVIDENCE_CHAIN_VALIDATION
Before claiming any relationship:
- "I believe X calls Y because..." → show actual code
- "This follows pattern Z because..." → cite specific examples
- "Service A owns B because..." → grep for actual boundaries

### TOOL_EFFICIENCY_PROTOCOL
- Batch multiple Grep searches into single calls with OR patterns
- Use parallel Read operations for related files

### CONTEXT_ANCHOR_SYSTEM
Every 10 operations:
1. Re-read the original task description
2. Verify the current operation aligns with original goals
3. Update the `Current Focus` in `## Progress` section

## PHASE 1: EXTERNAL MEMORY-DRIVEN BRANCH ANALYSIS

Build a structured knowledge model in `ai_task_analysis_notes/[comparison-name].ai_task_analysis_notes_temp.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND DISCOVERY

1. **Initialize** the analysis file with standard headings

### GIT BRANCH ANALYSIS DISCOVERY

**GIT_DIFF_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS**: Start with systematic git change detection:

1. **Primary Change Detection Commands**:
```bash
git diff --name-status [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git diff --stat [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git log --oneline [source-branch]..[target-branch]
```
Document results under `## Git Diff Analysis` and `## Commit History`.

2. **Change Impact & Scope Classification**: Document under `## Change Classification` and `## Change Scope Analysis`:
   - Types: Frontend, Backend, Config, DB
   - Purpose: Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor

**RELATED_FILES_COMPREHENSIVE_DISCOVERY**: For each changed file, discover all related components:
- Importers
- Dependencies
- Test files
- API consumers
- UI components

Save ALL changed files AND related files to `## Comprehensive File List` with:
- `filePath`
- `changeType`
- `relationshipType`
- `impactLevel`
- `serviceContext`

**INTELLIGENT_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT**: If file list exceeds 75, prioritize by impactLevel (Critical > High > Medium > Low).

### PHASE 1B: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

**IMPORTANT: MUST DO WITH TODO LIST**

For each file, document in `## Knowledge Graph`:
- All standard fields from feature-implementation skill
- Focus on change-specific context

### PHASE 1C: OVERALL ANALYSIS

Write comprehensive summary showing:
- Complete end-to-end workflows discovered
- Key architectural patterns and relationships
- Business logic workflows affected
- Integration points and dependencies

---

## PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING

Generate detailed analysis under these headings:

### 1. Code Review Analysis
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Security concerns
- Performance implications
- Maintainability

### 2. Refactoring Recommendations
- Immediate improvements
- Structural changes
- Technical debt items

### 3. Specification Update Plan
- New Requirements Discovery
- Test Specification Updates
- Documentation Strategy

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present comprehensive analysis, code review, refactoring recommendations, and specification update plan for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 4: SPECIFICATION UPDATE EXECUTION

Once approved, read existing specification document and update with:
- Requirements
- Test Specifications
- Architecture Documentation
- Code Review findings

---

## SUCCESS VALIDATION

Verify updated specification accurately reflects all changes. Document under `## Specification Validation`.

---

## Branch Comparison Guidelines

- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Start with `git diff` and base all updates on concrete code changes
- **Comprehensive Impact Assessment**: Analyze direct and indirect effects, including cross-service impacts
- **Enterprise Architecture Awareness**: Respect platform patterns, CQRS, and Clean Architecture
- **Quality-Focused Approach**: Perform thorough code review and identify refactoring opportunities
- **Specification Completeness**: Ensure full traceability between code, requirements, and tests
