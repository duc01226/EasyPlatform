description: "[Git] Use when the user asks to compare branches, analyze git diffs, review changes between branches, update specifications based on code changes, or analyze what changed. Triggers on keywords like "compare branches", "git diff", "what changed", "branch comparison", "code changes", "spec update"."

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze all file changes between git branches, perform impact analysis, and update specification documents.

**Workflow:**

1. **Discovery** — Run git diff/log, classify changes (Frontend/Backend, Feature/Bugfix)
2. **Knowledge Graph** — Document each changed file with dependencies, impact level, service context
3. **Analysis** — Code review (strengths, weaknesses, security), refactoring recommendations
4. **Approval Gate** — Present findings for explicit approval before updating specs
5. **Spec Update** — Update requirements, tests, architecture docs based on approved analysis

**Key Rules:**

- Must read `evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before executing
- All analysis must be evidence-based from actual git diffs
- Never proceed past approval gate without explicit user approval

# Branch Comparison & Specification Update

You are to operate as an expert full-stack dotnet angular principle developer, software architect, and technical analyst to analyze all file changes between branches, perform comprehensive impact analysis, and update specification documents.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

**Prerequisites:** **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/evidence-based-reasoning-protocol.md` before executing.

## PHASE 1: EXTERNAL MEMORY-DRIVEN BRANCH ANALYSIS

Build a structured knowledge model in `.ai/workspace/analysis/[comparison-name].analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND DISCOVERY

1. **Initialize** the analysis file with standard headings

### GIT BRANCH ANALYSIS DISCOVERY

**GIT_DIFF_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS**: Start with systematic git change detection:

1. **Primary Change Detection Commands**:

```bash
git diff --name-status [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git diff --stat [source-branch]..[target-branch]
git log --oneline [source-branch]..[target-branch]
```

Document results under `## Git Diff Analysis` and `## Commit History`.

2. **Change Impact & Scope Classification**: Document under `## Change Classification` and `## Change Scope Analysis`:
    - Types: Frontend, Backend, Config, DB
    - Purpose: Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor

**RELATED_FILES_COMPREHENSIVE_DISCOVERY**: For each changed file, discover all related components:

- Importers
- Dependencies
- Test files
- API consumers
- UI components

Save ALL changed files AND related files to `## Comprehensive File List` with:

- `filePath`
- `changeType`
- `relationshipType`
- `impactLevel`
- `serviceContext`

**INTELLIGENT_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT**: If file list exceeds 75, prioritize by impactLevel (Critical > High > Medium > Low).

### PHASE 1B: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

**IMPORTANT: MUST DO WITH TODO LIST**

For each file, document in `## Knowledge Graph`:

- All standard fields from feature-implementation skill
- Focus on change-specific context

### PHASE 1C: OVERALL ANALYSIS

Write comprehensive summary showing:

- Complete end-to-end workflows discovered
- Key architectural patterns and relationships
- Business logic workflows affected
- Integration points and dependencies

---

## PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING

Generate detailed analysis under these headings:

### 1. Code Review Analysis

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Security concerns
- Performance implications
- Maintainability

### 2. Refactoring Recommendations

- Immediate improvements
- Structural changes
- Technical debt items

### 3. Specification Update Plan

- New Requirements Discovery
- Test Specification Updates
- Documentation Strategy

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present comprehensive analysis, code review, refactoring recommendations, and specification update plan for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 4: SPECIFICATION UPDATE EXECUTION

Once approved, read existing specification document and update with:

- Requirements
- Test Specifications
- Architecture Documentation
- Code Review findings

---

## SUCCESS VALIDATION

Verify updated specification accurately reflects all changes. Document under `## Specification Validation`.

---

## Branch Comparison Guidelines

- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Start with `git diff` and base all updates on concrete code changes
- **Comprehensive Impact Assessment**: Analyze direct and indirect effects, including cross-service impacts
- **Enterprise Architecture Awareness**: Respect platform patterns, CQRS, and Clean Architecture
- **Quality-Focused Approach**: Perform thorough code review and identify refactoring opportunities
- **Specification Completeness**: Ensure full traceability between code, requirements, and tests

## Related

- `commit`
- `code-review`

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
