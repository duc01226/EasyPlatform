## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review UI code for WCAG 2.2 accessibility, Core Web Vitals performance, and modern web design best practices.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify Target** — Use provided file/pattern or ask user which components to review
2. **Scan Files** — Read and Grep target files for violation patterns
3. **Check Categories** — Accessibility, keyboard nav, forms, async states & feedback (loading/error/empty), animation, performance, touch/mobile, responsive layout (flex-wrap / row→column), content, dark mode/i18n
4. **Report Findings** — Group by file, use `file:line` format, terse findings, prioritized summary

**Key Rules:**

- Review-only skill: finds issues, does NOT fix them
- Check categories in priority order (accessibility first)
- Also reference `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` if available

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Web Design Guidelines Review

Review UI code for compliance with WCAG 2.2, Core Web Vitals, and modern web design best practices. This is a **review-only** skill -- it finds issues, not fixes them.

## When to Use

- Reviewing UI code for accessibility compliance before release
- Auditing a component or page for WCAG 2.2 violations
- Checking Core Web Vitals performance patterns in code
- Validating responsive design and mobile-friendly patterns
- Pre-PR UI quality gate check

## When NOT to Use

- **Building** UI -- use `design --lane=marketing` (marketing/creative) or `design --lane=product` (product UIs)
- **Creating** design specs -- use `design-spec`
- **Workflow-wired UI review gate** -- use `/ui-review` (the project UI review gate that runs in the `changes-review` parallel batch on frontend changes: long-content overflow, responsive flex, flex-vs-fixed sizing, z-index discipline, SCSS/BEM). This skill is the generic, framework-agnostic a11y/UX checklist that `/ui-review` cross-references — not a duplicate.
- Project SCSS review -- also check `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`

## Prerequisites

- Full guidelines reference: `references/guidelines.md`
- Project SCSS: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` (if available)

## Workflow

1. **Identify target files**
    - IF file/pattern argument provided → use it
    - IF not → ask user which files or components to review

2. **Scan files** using Read and Grep tools

3. **Check against categories** (in priority order):
    - **Accessibility** -- semantic HTML, ARIA, labels, alt text, color contrast, focus indicators
    - **Keyboard navigation** -- tab order, focus trap in modals, escape key handling
    - **Forms** -- labels, validation, error display, autocomplete, paste not blocked
    - **Async states & feedback** -- every fetch/submit/mutation renders a **loading** indicator (spinner/skeleton, never a frozen blank), a user-visible **error** with a retry/recovery path (never a silent failure or raw stack trace), an **empty** state for zero-item collections, and an in-flight **disabled** state on submit controls to prevent double-submit (canonical vocabulary: Default / Loading / Disabled / Error / Empty / Success)
    - **Animation** -- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, no `transition: all`, GPU-safe properties only
    - **Performance** -- image dimensions set, lazy loading, no layout thrashing, virtualization for large lists
    - **Touch/Mobile** -- touch targets >= 44px, `touch-action: manipulation`, safe areas
    - **Responsive layout** -- usable on small devices (owns all reflow/breakpoint concerns). Minimum bar: **preferred** reflow (rows `flex-wrap` or `row → column`, grids collapse to one column, fluid min/max/`%`/`rem` over large fixed px); **acceptable fallback** when a layout genuinely can't reflow (tables, canvases, wide grids) — a fixed `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` scroll (scrolling is OK, not a defect); **hard fail** only when content is broken on small screens — clipped, cut off, or a control unreachable with no scroll path. Big responsive refactor needed → flag it and confirm scope with the user, don't silently rewrite. Breakpoints tested at 320 / 768 / 1024px
    - **Content** -- long-text/overflow handling (`text-overflow`, wrapping, line clamp), readable line length _(empty-collection states → **Async states & feedback**; breakpoints/reflow → **Responsive layout**)_
    - **Dark mode / i18n** -- `color-scheme`, logical CSS properties, `Intl.*` formatters

4. **Report findings** in output format below

## UI/UX Design Principles Pass (9 dimensions)

The 40 clauses of `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` (full body inlined below in this skill) bind this review in the **REVIEW** role: each clause is a fail-condition. They do not replace the step-3 categories — they DEEPEN them. Run **NINE focused passes, one dimension at a time**, over the target files; a single simultaneous sweep of all nine is tick-boxing, which this skill's evidence rule already forbids. Answer each `Think:` prompt from first principles BEFORE hunting the violation it predicts.

**Every finding** keeps this skill's existing Output Format — `path:line - finding`, grouped by file — with the clause ID in the text, e.g. `{ui-source-root}/components/Button:42 - UI-3.1 measured contrast 3.1:1 on the disabled label (needs 4.5:1)`. This skill defines no severity tiers and this pass adds none: keep the existing accessibility-first priority ordering and the Summary counts.

**One rule, one finding.** Where a clause restates a category rule this skill already states (touch targets >= 44px, `prefers-reduced-motion`, loading/error/empty states, image dimensions, readable line length), report ONE finding citing both the category and the clause ID — never two.

| #   | Dimension                 | Clauses           | Deepens category                                | `Think:`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1   | Visual Hierarchy & Layout | `UI-1.1`-`UI-1.5` | Content · Async states & feedback               | Which element wins first read on this screen, and is it the one the page exists for? Is grouping done with whitespace or with borders? Are the empty, loading and error states designed at all?                                                                      |
| 2   | Typography                | `UI-2.1`-`UI-2.5` | Content                                         | How many families/weights ship on this page? What size does body text render at (16px web, 17px mobile, never below 14px), what measure does it reach (45-75 characters), what leading (1.5 body, 1.1-1.2 display)? Are sizes from a fixed 6-step scale or one-offs? |
| 3   | Colour & Contrast         | `UI-3.1`-`UI-3.4` | Accessibility · Dark mode / i18n                | What is the COMPUTED ratio for each rendered foreground/background pair (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges)? Does any state carry meaning through colour alone? Is dark mode a designed surface or an inversion?                                                              |
| 4   | Spacing & Grid            | `UI-4.1`-`UI-4.4` | Responsive layout                               | Is every gap a multiple of one 4px/8px base unit? Does spacing live on the container (`gap`) or on scattered child margins? Is inner padding smaller than the gap to the next group? Do breakpoints break where the layout fails, or where a device is named?        |
| 5   | Interaction & Feedback    | `UI-5.1`-`UI-5.5` | Keyboard navigation · Animation · Async states  | What changes within 100ms of a press? Which of the five states is unstyled? Is the focus ring still visible after restyling? Could undo replace this confirmation? Is motion 150-250ms ease-out and reduced-motion aware?                                            |
| 6   | Navigation & IA           | `UI-6.1`-`UI-6.4` | Accessibility (landmarks, skip links) · Content | Cold-landing on this view: where am I, what's here, where next? How many top-level destinations? Are labels the user's words or internal vocabulary? Does the state have a URL or a back path?                                                                       |
| 7   | Forms & Input             | `UI-7.1`-`UI-7.5` | Forms                                           | Per field: why does it exist today? Is the label visible once filled? When does validation fire, and does the message say how to fix it? Does the keyboard/autocomplete match the type? Does typed data survive an error, navigation, and refresh?                   |
| 8   | Mobile & Touch            | `UI-8.1`-`UI-8.4` | Touch/Mobile                                    | Measure the HIT BOX, not the icon: >=44x44pt with 8px separation? Where do primary actions sit relative to the thumb? Is anything gesture-only? Are notch, home indicator and keyboard accounted for? _(No touch surface in scope → skip with the reason stated.)_   |
| 9   | Speed & Perceived Speed   | `UI-9.1`-`UI-9.4` | Performance · Async states & feedback           | What occupies the space of each loading element, and does the layout shift when it lands? Skeleton or spinner — chosen deliberately? Is an optimistic update rolled back visibly? Are offline, timeout and retry designed states?                                    |

**Precedence:** `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` and any project design-system doc **OUTRANK** these clauses; a genuine conflict is reported with BOTH sides and taken to the user — NEVER resolved silently.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the 9-dimension UI/UX Design Principles pass — all 40 clauses (`UI-1.1`-`UI-9.4`), one dimension at a time; every finding cites `UI-<clause>` + `file:line` in the existing output format, and project SCSS/design-system docs OUTRANK the clauses (genuine conflict → surface both sides to the user)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
