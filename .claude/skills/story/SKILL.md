# User Story Creation

Break Product Backlog Items into implementable user stories using vertical slicing and SPIDR patterns.

## ⚠️ MUST READ References

**IMPORTANT: You MUST read these reference files for complete protocol. Do NOT skip.**

- **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/team-frameworks.md` — INVEST, SPIDR, MoSCoW frameworks
- **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/bdd-gherkin-templates.md` — BDD/Gherkin scenario templates
- **⚠️ MUST READ** `.claude/skills/shared/module-detection-keywords.md` — module detection keywords
- **⚠️ MUST READ** `references/story-patterns.md` — scenarios, templates, anti-patterns

## Pre-Workflow

- Activate `business-analyst` skill for domain context and requirements analysis

## When to Use

- PBI ready for story breakdown
- Feature needs vertical slicing
- Creating sprint-ready work items
- Story too large (effort >8)

## Workflow

1. Read PBI artifact and acceptance criteria
2. **Load domain context** if module detected (see `references/story-patterns.md`)
3. Identify vertical slices (end-to-end functionality)
4. **Apply SPIDR splitting** if stories too large (see shared frameworks)
5. Apply INVEST criteria to each story (see shared frameworks)
6. Create user stories with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN (min 3 scenarios)
7. Save to `team-artifacts/pbis/stories/`
8. **Validate stories** (MANDATORY) - Interview user
9. Suggest next: `/test-spec` or `/design-spec`

## Output

- **Path:** `team-artifacts/pbis/stories/{YYMMDD}-us-{pbi-slug}.md`
- **Format:** Single file with all stories (use ## headers per story)

## Story Format

```markdown
## Story N: {Title}

**As a** {user role}
**I want** {goal}
**So that** {benefit}

### Acceptance Criteria (min 3 scenarios: happy, edge, error)

```gherkin
Scenario: {Title}
  Given {context}
  When {action}
  Then {outcome}
```
```

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Each story follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] SPIDR splitting applied (effort <= 8, prefer <= 5)
- [ ] At least 3 scenarios per story: happy, edge, error
- [ ] All scenarios use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- [ ] Effort estimated in Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
- [ ] Stories independent (can develop in any order)
- [ ] Out of scope explicitly listed
- [ ] Dependencies identified (upstream/downstream)
- [ ] Domain vocabulary used correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] Validation interview completed (MANDATORY)

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
