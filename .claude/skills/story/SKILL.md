> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Break Product Backlog Items into implementable user stories using vertical slicing, SPIDR splitting, and INVEST criteria.

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** Plan ToDo Task to READ the following project-specific reference docs:
>
> - `project-structure-reference.md` -- project patterns and structure
>     > **Estimation Framework** — SP scale: 1(trivial) → 2(small) → 3(medium) → 5(large) → 8(very large, high risk) → 13(epic, SHOULD split) → 21(MUST split). MUST provide `story_points` and `complexity` estimate after investigation.
>     > MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/estimation-framework.md` for full protocol and checklists.
> - `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models) (content auto-injected by hook — check for [Injected: ...] header before reading)
> - `docs/test-specs/` — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs for related features; include test story/acceptance criteria for new stories)
>
> If file not found, search for: project documentation, coding standards, architecture docs.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read PBI** — Load PBI artifact, acceptance criteria, and domain context
2. **Vertical Slice** — Identify end-to-end slices of functionality
3. **SPIDR Split** — Apply Spike/Paths/Interfaces/Data/Rules splitting if effort >5
4. **Write Stories** — INVEST-validated stories with min 3 GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios each
5. **Validate** — Interview user to confirm slicing, acceptance criteria, and effort estimates

**Key Rules:**

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

> **UI System Context** — For frontend/UI/styling tasks, MUST READ these BEFORE implementing: `frontend-patterns-reference.md` (component base classes, stores, forms), `scss-styling-guide.md` (BEM methodology, SCSS vars, responsive), `design-system/README.md` (design tokens, component inventory, icons).
> MUST READ `.claude/skills/shared/ui-system-context.md` for full protocol and checklists.

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

- Stories with SP >8 MUST be split; >5 SHOULD be split (see estimation-framework.md)
- All stories MUST include `story_points` and `complexity` fields

## Greenfield Mode

> **Auto-detected:** If no existing codebase is found (no code directories like `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `packages/`, etc., no manifest files like `package.json`/`*.sln`/`go.mod`, no populated `project-config.json`), this skill switches to greenfield mode automatically. Planning artifacts (docs/, plans/, .claude/) don't count — the project must have actual code directories with content.

**When greenfield is detected:**

1. Generate **foundation PBIs** instead of feature stories: infrastructure setup, project scaffold, CI/CD pipeline, first feature vertical slice
2. Add dependency ordering: infrastructure stories BEFORE feature stories
3. Skip "MUST READ project-structure-reference.md" (won't exist)
4. Include setup stories: dev environment, build tooling, deployment pipeline, monitoring
5. Priority order: infra → scaffold → first feature → remaining features
6. **[CRITICAL] Architecture Scaffolding Story:** FIRST story = "Architecture Scaffolding" — all OOP/SOLID base abstract classes, generic interfaces, infrastructure abstractions per chosen tech stack. AI self-investigates what base classes the project needs. All feature stories depend on this.
7. Scaffolding acceptance criteria: all base classes compile/type-check, DI/IoC registrations resolve, smoke test passes
8. **UI System Foundation Story:** If the project has a frontend, generate a "UI System Foundation" story (Sprint 0) with these sub-stories:

    | Sub-Story                                                                 | SP  | Priority  | Depends On               |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------- | ------------------------ |
    | "Set up design token system"                                              | 2-3 | Must Have | Architecture Scaffolding |
    | "Create base layout and responsive grid"                                  | 2-3 | Must Have | Design tokens            |
    | "Create core UI components (loading, error, empty, toast, button, input)" | 3-5 | Must Have | Design tokens + layout   |

    **Dependency rule:** All UI feature stories MUST depend on "UI System Foundation" stories.

- Each story needs happy path, edge case, and error scenario (minimum)
- Use correct project domain vocabulary when available (check project docs for terminology)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# User Story Creation

Break Product Backlog Items into implementable user stories using vertical slicing and SPIDR patterns.

---

## Step 0: Locate Active Plan (if in workflow)

If running within a workflow (big-feature, greenfield-init, etc.):

1. **Search for active plan** — Glob `plans/*/plan.md` sorted by modification time, or check `TaskList` for plan context
2. **Read `plan.md`** — understand project scope, architecture decisions, domain model, implementation plan
3. **Read existing research** — `{plan-dir}/research/*.md` and `{plan-dir}/phase-*.md` for domain model, tech stack, architecture
4. **Read `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md`** (if exists) — understand existing domain entities for accurate story scoping
5. Use plan context to inform story slicing (architecture decisions affect how stories are split)

---

## When to Use

- PBI ready for story breakdown
- Feature needs vertical slicing
- Creating sprint-ready work items
- Story too large (effort >8)

---

## Quick Reference

### Workflow

1. Read PBI artifact and acceptance criteria
2. **Load domain context** (if project module detected)
3. Identify vertical slices (end-to-end functionality)
4. **Apply SPIDR splitting** if stories too large
5. Apply INVEST criteria to each story
6. Create user stories with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN (min 3 scenarios)
7. Save to `team-artifacts/pbis/stories/`
8. **Validate stories** (MANDATORY) - Interview user to confirm slicing, acceptance criteria, and effort
9. Suggest next: `/test-spec` or `/design-spec`

### Output

- **Path:** `team-artifacts/pbis/stories/{YYMMDD}-us-{pbi-slug}.md`
- **Format:** Single file with all stories (use ## headers per story)

---

## Project Domain Context Loading

When slicing domain-related PBIs, automatically load business context.

### Step 1: Detect Module

**From PBI frontmatter:**

1. Check `module` field
2. If missing, detect from keywords (ref: `.claude/skills/shared/module-detection-keywords.md`)

### Step 2: Load Feature Context

```
Glob("docs/business-features/{module}/detailed-features/*.md")
```

1. Read module README (first 200 lines)
2. Identify related feature from `related_features` list
3. Extract existing business rules (BR-{MOD}-XXX)
4. Note entity names from feature docs

### Step 3: Apply Domain Vocabulary

Read `docs/project-config.json` modules[] and `docs/business-features/` to detect domain vocabulary per module. Use entity names from feature docs — avoid ambiguous synonyms.

### Step 4: Include in Story

```markdown
## Domain Context

**Module:** {detected module}
**Feature:** {related feature}
**Entities:** {Entity1}, {Entity2}
**Business Rules:** BR-{MOD}-XXX (from feature docs)
```

---

## INVEST Criteria

| Criterion       | Definition                       | Validation Question                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **I**ndependent | No dependencies on other stories | Can this be developed in any order?  |
| **N**egotiable  | Details can change               | Is the "how" open for discussion?    |
| **V**aluable    | Delivers user value              | Does user get observable benefit?    |
| **E**stimable   | Can estimate story points        | Can team size this? (Fibonacci 1-21) |
| **S**mall       | Completable in sprint            | SP ≤8? (prefer ≤5)                   |
| **T**estable    | Clear acceptance criteria        | Can we write pass/fail tests?        |

---

## SPIDR Splitting Checklist

**When to apply:** Story SP >8 MUST split. SP >5 SHOULD split. SP 13 = SHOULD split into 2-3 stories. SP 21 = MUST split (epic-level).

| Pattern        | Question                     | Split Strategy                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **S**pike      | Unknown complexity?          | Create research spike first, then stories |
| **P**aths      | Multiple workflow branches?  | One story per path/choice                 |
| **I**nterfaces | Multiple UIs or APIs?        | One story per interface                   |
| **D**ata       | Multiple data formats/types? | One story per data variation              |
| **R**ules      | Multiple business rules?     | One story per rule variation              |

### Splitting Examples

**Paths:** "User can pay by card OR PayPal" → Story A: Card payment, Story B: PayPal payment

**Data:** "Import CSV, Excel, JSON" → Story A: CSV import, Story B: Excel import, Story C: JSON import

**Rules:** "Different approval flows by amount" → Story A: <$1000 auto-approve, Story B: >$1000 manager approval

### Size Validation

```
SP 1-5:   ✅ Good size
SP 6-8:   ⚠️ Consider splitting (apply SPIDR)
SP 13:    ❌ SHOULD split into 2-3 stories
SP 21:    ❌ MUST split — epic-level, not sprint-ready
```

---

## Scenario Templates

### Minimum 3 scenarios per story:

### 1. Happy Path (Positive)

```gherkin
Scenario: User successfully {completes action}
  Given {user has required permissions/state}
  And {required data exists}
  When user {performs valid action}
  Then {primary expected outcome}
  And {secondary verification if needed}
```

### 2. Edge Case (Boundary)

```gherkin
Scenario: System handles {boundary condition}
  Given {edge state: empty list, max items, zero value}
  When user {attempts action at boundary}
  Then {appropriate handling: pagination, warning, default}
```

### 3. Error Case (Negative)

```gherkin
Scenario: System prevents {invalid action}
  Given {precondition}
  When user {provides invalid input OR unauthorized action}
  Then error message "{specific error message}"
  And {system remains in valid state}
  And {no partial changes saved}
```

### 4. Authorization (MANDATORY per story)

```gherkin
Scenario: Unauthorized user cannot {perform action}
  Given user has role {unauthorized role}
  When user attempts to {action}
  Then system rejects with "Forbidden" or "Unauthorized"
  And no data is modified
```

> Ref: `.claude/skills/shared/cross-cutting-quality-concerns-protocol.md` §1

### Additional Scenario Types

**Performance:** Response time under load
**Concurrency:** Simultaneous user actions
**Integration:** External service unavailable

## Sprint 0 / Foundation Stories (Production Readiness)

> Ref: `.claude/skills/shared/scaffold-production-readiness-protocol.md`

When the PBI includes a "Production Readiness Concerns" table with "Required" items, automatically generate Sprint 0 / foundation stories for each concern:

| PBI Concern | Story Title | Story Points | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Code linting/analyzers = Required | "Set up code linting and formatting" | 1-2 SP | Must Have |
| Error handling setup = Required | "Set up error handling foundation" | 2-3 SP | Must Have |
| Loading indicators = Required | "Set up loading indicator infrastructure" | 1-2 SP | Must Have |
| Docker integration = Required | "Set up Docker development environment" | 2-3 SP | Must Have |
| CI/CD quality gates = Required | "Set up CI/CD quality gates" | 2-3 SP | Must Have |
| Seed data = Required | "Set up seed data / data seeder" | 2-3 SP | Must Have |
| Data migration = Required | "Create data migration for schema changes" | 1-3 SP | Must Have |

> Ref: `.claude/skills/shared/cross-cutting-quality-concerns-protocol.md` §2, §5

### Rules
- Foundation stories MUST be completed before feature stories begin
- Mark as `sprint: 0` or `sprint: foundation` in story metadata
- Each foundation story references the specific protocol section for implementation guidance
- If PBI concern = "Existing", skip story generation (already set up)
- If PBI concern = "No", skip story generation (explicitly opted out)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern       | Problem                                           | Correct Approach                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Horizontal slicing | "Backend story" + "Frontend story" = delays value | Vertical slice: thin end-to-end functionality |
| Single scenario    | Missing edge/error cases                          | Minimum 3 scenarios: happy, edge, error       |
| Vague criteria     | "Fast", "user-friendly" untestable                | Quantify: "< 200ms", "≤ 3 clicks"             |
| Solution-speak     | "Use Redis cache" constrains team                 | Outcome: "Results return within 200ms"        |
| Effort >8          | Won't fit sprint, hard to estimate                | Apply SPIDR, split until ≤8                   |
| No error scenario  | Missing negative test coverage                    | Always include invalid input handling         |
| Generic persona    | "As a user" too vague                             | Specific: "As a hiring manager"               |

---

## Key Rules

- **Every story set MUST include a Story Dependencies table** — with types: `must-after`, `can-parallel`, `blocked-by`, `independent`. This enables `/prioritize` and `/plan` to respect implementation ordering.
- **SPIDR splits MUST include dependency chains** — When splitting a story, declare which split stories depend on others.
- **No orphan stories** — Every story must appear in the dependency table, even if independent.

## Quality Checklist

Before completing user stories:

- [ ] Each story follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] SPIDR splitting applied (effort ≤8, prefer ≤5)
- [ ] At least 3 scenarios per story: happy, edge, error
- [ ] All scenarios use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- [ ] Effort estimated in Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
- [ ] Stories independent (can develop in any order)
- [ ] Out of scope explicitly listed
- [ ] Story Dependencies table included with all stories listed
- [ ] Dependency types correct (must-after, can-parallel, blocked-by, independent)
- [ ] Parent PBI linked in frontmatter
- [ ] Domain vocabulary used correctly (if the project)
- [ ] Authorization scenario included per story (unauthorized access rejection)
- [ ] Seed data story included if PBI has seed data requirements
- [ ] Data migration story included if PBI has schema changes
- [ ] Validation interview completed

---

## Validation Step (MANDATORY)

After creating user stories, validate with user.

### Question Categories

| Category         | Example Question                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slicing**      | "Are the story slices independent enough?"          |
| **Size**         | "Any story >8 effort that needs further splitting?" |
| **Scenarios**    | "Any acceptance criteria missing for edge cases?"   |
| **Dependencies** | "Are there hidden dependencies between stories?"    |
| **Scope**        | "Should anything be explicitly excluded?"           |

### Process

1. Generate 2-4 questions focused on slicing quality, scenarios, and dependencies
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to interview
3. Document in story artifact under `## Validation Summary`
4. Update stories based on answers (split if needed)

**This step is NOT optional.**

## MANDATORY: Systematic Task Breakdown for Stories

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** break down ALL stories into small, systematic todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting implementation. Each story MUST have its own set of tasks that cover:

1. **Read & understand story** — Load story artifact, acceptance criteria, domain context
2. **Identify vertical slice layers** — Backend entity/command/query, frontend component/store/API, integration points
3. **Create implementation subtasks per layer** — One task per file or logical unit (entity, command handler, DTO, component, service, test)
4. **Include spec tasks** — Each story MUST have corresponding test specifications (unit, integration, or E2E as appropriate)
5. **Include validation task** — Verify story against acceptance criteria GIVEN/WHEN/THEN after implementation
6. **Include review task** — Final quality check per story

### Task Naming Convention

```

[Story US-{ID}] {Layer}: {Description}

```

Example for a "Create Goal" story:
```

[Story US-001] Entity: Create Goal entity with validation rules
[Story US-001] Command: CreateGoalCommand + Handler
[Story US-001] DTO: GoalDto with mapping
[Story US-001] API: POST /api/goals endpoint
[Story US-001] Component: GoalCreateFormComponent
[Story US-001] Store: GoalVmStore with create action
[Story US-001] Test: Integration test for CreateGoalCommand
[Story US-001] Test: E2E test for goal creation flow
[Story US-001] Review: Verify against AC scenarios

```

**Why:** Without systematic task breakdown, stories become monolithic — leading to missed edge cases, incomplete specs, and context loss during implementation.

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:
- **"/tdd-spec (Recommended)"** — Generate test specifications from stories
- **"/pbi-mockup"** — Generate HTML mockup report from PBI and stories
- **"/plan-validate"** — If stories need validation against plan
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** add a final review todo task to verify work quality.
````

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST** READ the following files before starting:

- **MUST** READ `.claude/skills/shared/estimation-framework.md` before starting
- **MUST** READ `.claude/skills/shared/ui-system-context.md` before starting
