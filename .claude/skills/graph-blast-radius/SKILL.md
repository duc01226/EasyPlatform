# Blast Radius

Analyze the structural impact of current code changes using the knowledge graph.

## Prerequisites

- Graph must be built first: run `/graph-build` if `.code-graph/graph.db` doesn't exist
- Requires Python 3.10+ with tree-sitter, tree-sitter-language-pack, networkx

## Steps

1. **Check graph exists** — Verify `.code-graph/graph.db` exists. If not, suggest `/graph-build`.

2. **Run blast-radius analysis** via Bash:

    ```bash
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph blast-radius --json
    ```

3. **Parse JSON output** and present:
    - **Changed files:** List of modified files (auto-detected from git)
    - **Changed nodes:** Functions/classes directly modified
    - **Impacted nodes:** Functions/classes affected within 2 hops (callers, dependents, tests)
    - **Impacted files:** Additional files that may need attention
    - **Truncation:** If results were truncated, note total vs shown

4. **Risk assessment** based on blast radius size:
    - **Low risk:** <5 impacted nodes, changes well-contained
    - **Medium risk:** 5-20 impacted nodes, review callers carefully
    - **High risk:** >20 impacted nodes, consider splitting PR

5. **Recommendations:**
    - Flag untested changed functions
    - Suggest files to prioritize in review
    - Warn about inheritance/implementation relationship changes

## Trace for Deep Impact Analysis

For impact beyond direct callers/importers, use the `trace` command to follow the full chain through implicit connections:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <changed-file> --direction downstream --depth 3 --json

# File-level overview first (10-30x less noise), then drill into functions:
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <changed-file> --direction downstream --node-mode file --json
```

This reveals downstream impact through MESSAGE_BUS edges (cross-service event consumers), TRIGGERS_EVENT (entity event handlers), and other implicit relationships that blast-radius may not surface directly.

## Additional Queries

For deeper investigation, run via Bash:

- `python ... query callers_of <function> --json` — who calls this function?
- `python ... query tests_for <function> --json` — what tests cover this?
- `python ... query inheritors_of <class> --json` — what inherits from this?
- `python ... query importers_of <file> --json` — who imports this file?
