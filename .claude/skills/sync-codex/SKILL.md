description: '[Codex] Use when you need to run full Codex mirror sync (migrate → hooks → context → verify) standalone, no npm/package JSON needed.'
disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Run full Codex mirror sync standalone — equivalent to `npm run codex:sync` without `package.json` or `npm`.

> **Renamed:** formerly `/codex-sync` — that name no longer resolves as a slash command; use `/sync-codex`.

Also bootstraps team-wide Codex completion notifications by copying the portable `.claude/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs` helper into `.codex/scripts/codex/` and upserting notification plus TUI status-line keys into `.codex/config.toml`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Run** — `node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs`
2. **Verify** — Exit code `0` = pass; check stdout summary
3. **Inspect** — On failure, re-run failing stage manually with `--only=<stage>` and `--verbose`

**Key Rules:**

- MUST run all 9 stages in order — orchestrator fails fast on first non-zero exit
- NEVER edit `.agents/skills/sync-codex/**` (auto-mirror) — edit `.claude/skills/sync-codex/**` source instead
- `.claude` is the source for skills/workflows/hooks; generated acceptance targets are `.agents/skills/**`, `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md`, and `AGENTS.md`
- Stages 1-4 mutate `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/` (Copilot mirror); stages 5-9 are read-only verifiers
- Stage 1 upserts `[tui].status_line` to show model+reasoning, current directory, project root, context used, five-hour limit, and weekly limit by default
- Stage 3 mirrors full `CLAUDE.md` into `AGENTS.md`, then appends the generated Codex hook/context mirror and shared AI-SDD markers so Codex has both source instructions and hookless parity context
- Stage 1 must not inline `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` content into `.agents/skills/**`; generated skill mirrors reference the project-reference loading gate instead
- The `SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract` marker must appear after sync in `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- No npm dependency — pure `node` + spawned subprocesses
- Idempotent — safe to re-run; second run produces only timestamp diffs

## Bootstrap Gate (when AGENTS.md is missing or incomplete)

This skill is the route the agent-files bootstrap gate offers for a missing — **or incomplete** —
root `AGENTS.md`, the generated Codex mirror of `CLAUDE.md`. Because Codex has no hooks, the universal
session-start guides must be embedded in `AGENTS.md` directly; stage 3 produces that mirror (full
`CLAUDE.md` copy, so the `<!-- CK:UNIVERSAL-GUIDES v1 -->` sentinel propagates) + hookless-parity context.

"Incomplete" means the file exists but lacks the universal guides — same three-state detection as the
CLAUDE.md route (`missing` → init, `incomplete` → update smart-merge preserving project content, `ok`
→ no block), decided by the shared sentinel-then-anchors check.

The gate is **user-invoke-only** for this route (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — the AI cannot
self-run `/sync-codex`, so the gate instructs it to _ask the user_ to run it. Detection is shared with
the CLAUDE.md route via `.claude/hooks/lib/agent-files-state.cjs`. Opt out of completeness enforcement
with `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` in `docs/project-config.json` (default `true`);
`skip init` dismisses both hooks for 24h. Generate `CLAUDE.md` first (via `/claude-md-init`) — stage 3
reads it as the mirror source.

## Stages

9 stages, sequential, matching `npm run codex:sync`:

| #   | Stage    | Script                                                       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1   | migrate  | `.claude/scripts/codex/migrate-claude-to-codex.mjs`          | Migrate Claude agents → `.codex/agents/`; mirror skills → `.agents/skills/`; setup Codex notifications                                                                                         |
| 2   | hooks    | `.claude/scripts/codex/sync-hooks.mjs`                       | Generate `.codex/hooks.json` + sync report                                                                                                                                                     |

## Usage

```bash
# Full sync (standalone, no npm):
node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs

# Stream live child output:
node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --verbose

# Full sync while forcing skill copy mode:
node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --copy-skills

# Read-only verifiers (no mutation):
node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --only=tests,wf-cycle,sk-proto,residue,sdd

# Skip stages while debugging:
node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs --skip=migrate,hooks
```

**Exit codes:** `0` all pass · `1` orchestrator failure · non-zero propagates from failing stage.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

## Closing Reminders

**MUST ATTENTION** invoke ONLY when user explicitly requests codex sync — never auto-invoke
**MUST ATTENTION** edit source `.claude/skills/sync-codex/**`, NEVER the `.agents/skills/sync-codex/**` mirror
**MUST ATTENTION** keep `.codex/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs` generated from `.claude/scripts/codex/codex-notify.mjs`; edit the `.claude` source first
**MUST ATTENTION** keep Codex config upserts surgical; preserve unrelated `.codex/config.toml` keys and tables while updating the managed notification/status-line keys
**MUST ATTENTION** keep `AGENTS.md` sync comprehensive; mirror full `CLAUDE.md` plus generated hook/context blocks, and preserve unmanaged `AGENTS.md` preface text
**MUST ATTENTION** keep learned-lessons content out of `.agents/skills/**`; skills may point to `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` but must not embed its entries
**MUST ATTENTION** orchestrator fails fast — re-run single failing stage with `--only=<id> --verbose` to debug
**MUST ATTENTION** working directory auto-resolves to repo root from script path — do not pass `--cwd`
**MUST ATTENTION** stages 1-4 mutate; stages 5-9 verify only — use `--only=` for non-destructive validation

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                  | Rebuttal                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Just edit the .agents mirror directly"  | Next sync overwrites it. Always edit `.claude/skills/sync-codex/` source     |
| "Skip a stage to save time"              | Verifiers (4-8) catch drift; skipping = silent regression risk               |
| "Auto-invoke since user mentioned codex" | `disable-model-invocation: true` is binding. Wait for explicit `/sync-codex` |
| "Sync looks idempotent, skip verify"     | Timestamp diffs are normal; structural diffs = bug. Always run verifiers     |

> **[USER-INVOKED ONLY]** Manually triggered via `$sync-codex`. Claude MUST NOT auto-invoke — `disable-model-invocation: true` enforces this.
> **[FAILS FAST]** First non-zero stage exit aborts chain. Re-run failing stage manually to debug.
> **[REPO ROOT]** Orchestrator auto-resolves repo root from its own path. NEVER pass `--cwd`.
