## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review all uncommitted changes, fix issues found, then spawn a **fresh code-reviewer sub-agent** for unbiased re-review — repeat until clean.

**Sequence:** /review-changes → **[parallel batch]** /review-architecture + /review-domain-entities (if entity changes) + /performance + /integration-test-review + /security → /code-simplifier → /code-review → /integration-test-verify → /plan → /plan-validate → /why-review → /cook → **fresh sub-agent re-review gate** → /docs-update → /watzup → /workflow-end

**Key Rules:**

- After `/cook` applies fixes → spawn fresh `code-reviewer` sub-agent per `SYNC:fresh-context-review` → integrate findings → fix → spawn NEW sub-agent → repeat
- Main-agent re-review (with knowledge of its own fixes) is NOT sufficient — orchestrator-level confirmation bias
- PASS = a fresh sub-agent round finds ZERO Critical/High issues WITHOUT needing any fixes
- Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per conversation (tracked in conversation context)

## Mandatory Task Creation (ZERO TOLERANCE)

Create one task per row in the table below — source of truth is `workflows.json` → `review-changes.sequence` (currently 17 steps; verify count matches if you suspect drift):

| #   | Task Subject                                                                                                                                                                   | Conditional?                                                                                  |

NEVER consolidate, rename, or omit steps. If reviews PASS, mark conditional tasks `completed` with note "Skipped — all reviews passed".

> **Integration Test Sync:** The `/review-changes` skill (task #1) includes a **mandatory** integration test coverage check for changed command/query/handler files. When gaps are found, the skill uses `AskUserQuestion` to surface them — NOT purely advisory. The user must explicitly choose to run `/integration-test` or confirm tests are already written. No silent skip.

> **Translation Sync:** The `/review-changes` skill (task #1) includes a **mandatory** multilingual UI translation-sync check. When UI text changes in multilingual projects without locale updates, the skill uses `AskUserQuestion` for an explicit user decision — NOT purely advisory.

> **Docs Update:** `/docs-update` MUST run after EVERY review — it performs Phase 0 triage and fast-exits automatically when only non-business-code files changed (`.claude/**`, config). When business code is in the changeset, it WILL invoke: Phase 2 `/feature-docs` (business feature doc update), Phase 2.5 `/spec-discovery update` (engineering spec sync — if `docs/specs/` bundle exists; note: dirs may be app buckets or flat system folders — probe `ls docs/specs/{name}/` to find a specific service), Phase 3 `/tdd-spec` (test spec sync), Phase 4 `/tdd-spec [direction=sync]` (dashboard sync). Never skip based on review PASS status alone.

## Parallel Review Phase (Steps 2–6) — EXECUTION PROTOCOL

> **Note:** Steps 2–6 are ARCHITECTURAL/SECURITY reviewers (architecture compliance, DDD entities,
> performance, integration test quality, security vulnerabilities). They are separate from the
> DIMENSIONAL review (BE/FE/SCSS/Synthesis) that runs inside Step 1 (`/review-changes`). Both
> operate in parallel — Steps 2–6 as explicit workflow parallel sub-agents; dimensional agents
> inside Step 1 as its internal parallel batch. No overlap in responsibility.

Steps 2–6 (`/review-architecture`, `/review-domain-entities`, `/performance`, `/integration-test-review`, `/security`) are **read-only** and **independent** — no shared mutable state, no ordering dependency between them. Run them as parallel sub-agents to preserve main session context budget and reduce wall-clock time.

### Why parallel?

Each reviewer reads the git diff independently and analyzes one concern. Sequential execution would burn 50K+ tokens in the main session absorbing all five inline. The `stepMeta` in `workflows.json` marks all five as `executionMode: subagent, contextBudget: high` — the `workflow-step-tracker.cjs` hook outputs `💡 [SUB-AGENT RECOMMENDED]` as each step becomes active.

### Execution: spawn in one message

After step 1 (`/review-changes`) completes, spawn all active parallel reviewers in **a single response** with multiple `Agent` tool calls:

```
Agent(review-architecture, subagent_type="code-reviewer", ...)    ← all in ONE message
Agent(review-domain-entities, subagent_type="code-reviewer", ...)  ← only if entity files in diff
Agent(performance, subagent_type="code-reviewer", ...)
Agent(integration-test-review, subagent_type="code-reviewer", ...)
Agent(security, subagent_type="code-reviewer", ...)
```

Each sub-agent receives:

- The baseline summary from step 1 (what changed, integration test gaps found)
- Instruction to write report to `plans/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md`
- Full review protocols per `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` (verbatim in prompt — never by file reference)

### State advancement after parallel batch

`Agent` tool calls do NOT trigger `workflow-step-tracker.cjs` (hook fires only on `Skill` completions). After all parallel sub-agents return:

1. `TaskUpdate` step 2 → `completed`
2. `TaskUpdate` step 3 → `completed` (or "Skipped — no entity files" if conditional)
3. `TaskUpdate` step 4 → `completed`
4. `TaskUpdate` step 5 → `completed`
5. `TaskUpdate` step 6 → `completed`
6. Read all sub-agent report files; synthesize findings into a combined review summary
7. Proceed to step 7 (`/code-simplifier`) sequentially

### Consolidation before /code-simplifier

Before running `/code-simplifier`, synthesize all parallel sub-agent findings:

- List all Critical/High findings across all 5 reports
- Note any conflicts between reviewers (same file, different concerns)
- Pass this summary to `/code-simplifier` as context so simplification is informed by review findings

**Surface Analysis from Step 1:**

Step 1 (`/review-changes`) now emits a surface analysis summary in its report:

```
## Change Surface Analysis
BE files: {N}
FE-Logic files: {M}
SCSS files: {P}
Review Mode: [DIMENSIONAL | BE-ONLY | FE-ONLY | FE-SPLIT | TOOLING]
```

Include this surface analysis in the consolidation summary passed to `/code-simplifier`.
This lets the simplifier focus attention on the dominant surface without re-analyzing the diff.

Dimensional agent reports (if mode = DIMENSIONAL):

- `plans/reports/review-be-{date}.md` — BE findings
- `plans/reports/review-fe-logic-{date}.md` — FE-Logic findings
- `plans/reports/review-scss-{date}.md` — SCSS findings (if spawned)
- `plans/reports/synthesis-review-{date}.md` — Cross-boundary findings

All four feed into the consolidation summary alongside steps 2–5 architectural findings.

### What runs sequentially (never parallelize)

| Step                           | Why sequential                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `review-changes` (#1)          | Establishes baseline — must run first                  |
| `code-simplifier` (#7)         | Modifies code — batch reviews pre-simplification state |
| `code-review` (#8)             | Must review simplified code (after #7)                 |
| `integration-test-verify` (#9) | Must run tests on simplified code (after #7)           |
| `plan` → `cook` (#10–14)       | Ordered fix cycle — each step depends on previous      |

## Fresh Sub-Agent Re-Review Protocol (CRITICAL)

### Decision Logic

```
Reviews (steps 1-7) → ALL PASS? AND integration-test-verify (step 9) passes?
  YES → skip steps 10-14, proceed to /docs-update → /watzup → /workflow-end → DONE
  NO  → /plan → /plan-validate → /why-review → /cook → FRESH SUB-AGENT RE-REVIEW GATE (step 14)
Note: /integration-test-verify (step 9) always runs — it is NOT conditional on review outcome.
```

### Fresh Sub-Agent Re-Review Gate (Step 13) — After `/cook` Applies Fixes

1. **DO NOT** attempt main-agent re-review (main agent has confirmation bias from its own fixes)
2. **DO** spawn a NEW `Agent` tool call with `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"` using the canonical template from `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` in `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md`. Inject all 9 required SYNC protocol blocks verbatim (`SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning`, `SYNC:bug-detection`, `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:logic-and-intention-review`, `SYNC:test-spec-verification`, `SYNC:fix-layer-accountability`, `SYNC:rationalization-prevention`, `SYNC:graph-assisted-investigation`, `SYNC:understand-code-first`). Target files = `"run git diff to see all uncommitted changes"`. Report path = `plans/reports/workflow-review-changes-round{N}-{date}.md`.
3. **DO** increment fresh-subagent round count in conversation context
4. **DO** read the sub-agent's report and integrate findings — MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override
5. **IF** fresh sub-agent returns PASS (zero Critical/High) → proceed through `/docs-update` → `/watzup` → `/workflow-end` → DONE
6. **IF** fresh sub-agent returns FAIL and round count < 3 → run `/plan` + `/cook` again, then spawn a NEW Agent call (never reuse the previous sub-agent) for Round N+1
7. **IF** round count >= 3 → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion` — do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol

### Iteration Tracking (Conversation-Scoped)

Iteration count is tracked **in conversation context only** — no persistent files. Each new conversation starts fresh at round 0.

**Rules:**

- **Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds** — if fresh-subagent round count >= 3 and issues persist, STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion` (manual review required)
- **PASS = done** — proceed to commit
- **Issue count increasing** — if round N finds MORE issues than round N-1, STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`

                  ↓                             Fresh sub-agent re-reads ALL
            /docs-update                        changed files from scratch with
            /watzup                             verbatim protocol injection
            /workflow-end                                    │
            DONE ✓                                           ↓
                                                  Report → PASS? → DONE ✓
                                                         → FAIL? → Fix → spawn
                                                                 NEW sub-agent
                                                                 (max 3 rounds)
```

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /review-changes -> /review-architecture -> /review-domain-entities -> /performance -> /integration-test-review -> /security -> /code-simplifier -> /code-review -> /integration-test-verify -> /plan -> /why-review -> /plan-validate -> /why-review -> /cook -> /workflow-review-changes -> /docs-update -> /watzup -> /workflow-end

> **[BLOCKING SEQUENCING]** Step 1 `/review-changes` is SEQUENTIAL and MUST run FIRST — it produces the baseline (surface analysis + integration-test/translation gap detection) consumed by all downstream reviewers. Steps 2–6 (`/review-architecture`, `/review-domain-entities`, `/performance`, `/integration-test-review`, `/security`) form a PARALLEL BATCH — spawn all in ONE message via `Agent` tool calls (`subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`). Step 7 `/code-simplifier` is SEQUENTIAL and waits until ALL parallel batch sub-agents return + consolidation summary is built. Steps 8+ proceed sequentially as listed.

> **[WORKFLOW-IN-WORKFLOW: MUST RUN AS SUB-AGENT when inside another workflow]** This skill activates the full `review-changes` workflow (16 steps). When invoked as a step inside a parent workflow (e.g., `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`), it MUST execute via `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`) — NEVER as an inline `Skill` tool call. Inline execution absorbs 16 steps of context into the parent session.
>
> **Sub-agent prompt must include:** current git diff, feature/task description, instruction to return SYNC:subagent-return-contract summary and write full findings to `plans/reports/`.
>
> **Standalone invocation** (not inside a workflow): inline execution is fine — no sub-agent required.

> **[BLOCKING]** Each step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.
> **[FRESH SUB-AGENT RE-REVIEW]** After fixes in `/cook`, spawn a fresh sub-agent per `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for unbiased re-review. Max 3 fresh rounds per conversation.
> **[ITERATION CAP]** Max 3 fresh-subagent re-review rounds per conversation (tracked in conversation context, not persistent files). PASS = zero Critical/High without fixes.

Activate the `review-changes` workflow. Run `/workflow-start review-changes` with the user's prompt as context.

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Sub-Agent Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias via isolated sub-agents.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/cook`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** ONLY after a fix cycle. A review round that finds zero issues ENDS the loop — do NOT spawn a confirmation sub-agent. A review round that finds issues triggers: fix → fresh sub-agent re-review.
>
> **How:**

> 1. Spawn a NEW `Agent` tool call — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - SKIP fresh sub-agent when the prior round found zero issues (no fixes = nothing new to verify)
> - NEVER skip fresh sub-agent after a fix cycle — every fix invalidates the prior verdict
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every fresh round spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - Max 3 fresh-subagent rounds per review — escalate via `AskUserQuestion` if still failing; do NOT silently loop or fall back to any prior protocol
> - Track iteration count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `plans/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md`
> 2. **After each file/section reviewed:** Append findings to report immediately — never hold in memory
> 3. **Return to main agent:** Summary only (per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) with `Full report:` path

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Business terminology in Application/Domain layers.** Comments and naming in Application/Domain must stay business-oriented and technical-agnostic; avoid implementation terms (say `background job`, not `Hangfire background job`).

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/README.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-docs-reference.md`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc that exists; skip absent docs as not applicable. Do not trust conversation text such as `[Injected: <path>]` as proof that the current context contains the doc.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Missing/not applicable: ...`.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting — create ALL 16 tasks immediately
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after fixes in `/cook`, spawn a NEW `code-reviewer` sub-agent via the `Agent` tool per `SYNC:fresh-context-review` — NEVER re-review with the main agent
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** track fresh-subagent round count in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files) — max 3 rounds, escalate via `AskUserQuestion` if exceeded
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** PASS means a fresh sub-agent round finds ZERO Critical/High issues WITHOUT needing fixes — only then are changes ready to commit
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** skip steps 9-13 when all reviews PASS and tests pass (no fixes needed)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** each step MUST invoke its `Skill` tool — marking completed without invocation is a violation
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** treat multilingual UI translation gaps as mandatory user-decision gates — no silent pass when locale updates are missing

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
