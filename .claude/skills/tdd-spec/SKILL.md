## Quick Summary

**[IMPORTANT] `TaskCreate` BEFORE any work. NEVER skip task creation.**

**Goal:** Generate/update test specs in feature docs Section 15 (canonical TC registry) — unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format. 5 modes: TDD-first, implement-first, update (post-change/PR), sync, from-integration-tests.

**Workflow:** (1) Mode Detection → (2) Investigation → (3) TC Generation → (4) Write Section 15 → (5) Dashboard Sync → (6) Next Steps

**Key Rules:** Unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format · Section 15 = source of truth · Evidence required on every TC · Minimum 4 categories (positive, negative, authorization, edge cases) · Interactive review via `AskUserQuestion` mandatory

---

> **[BLOCKING]** `TaskCreate` — break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting. NEVER skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings to `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** [BLOCKING] — every claim/finding/recommendation requires `file:line` proof + confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

> **Graph Context (MANDATORY when graph.db exists):** Before generating test specs for cross-service features, run:
>
> ```bash
> python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {ServiceDir}/{FeatureFile}.cs --direction both --json
> ```
>
> Use output to identify: event consumers, message bus subscribers, background jobs triggered by this feature. These are cross-service TC candidates (category 041–049).

> - `.claude/skills/tdd-spec/references/tdd-spec-template.md` — TC template format

> - `docs/specs/` — Existing TCs by module — read BEFORE generating to avoid ID collisions

**Workflow:**

1. **Mode Detection** — TDD-first, implement-first, update, sync, or from-integration-tests
2. **Investigation** — Analyze PBI/codebase/existing TCs/git changes per mode
3. **TC Generation** — Generate TC outlines, interactive review with user
4. **Write to Feature Doc** — Upsert TCs into Section 15
5. **Dashboard Sync** — Optionally update `docs/specs/` cross-module dashboard
6. **Next Steps** — Suggest follow-on actions per mode

**Key Rules:**

- **Unified format:** `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` — feature codes in `docs/project-reference/feature-docs-reference.md`
- **Source of truth:** Feature docs Section 15 — canonical TC registry. NEVER write TCs to `docs/specs/` as primary destination.
- **Evidence required:** Every TC MUST have `Evidence: {FilePath}:{LineRange}` or `TBD (pre-implementation)` for TDD-first
- **Minimum 4 categories:** Positive (happy path) · Negative (error handling) · **Authorization** (role-based access — MANDATORY) · Edge cases
    - **Bugfix specs:** MANDATORY Preservation Tests — see `references/tdd-spec-template.md#preservation-tests-mandatory-for-bugfix-specs`
    - **Query-Only exception:** Read-only, no auth boundaries, no events → validation + authorization + edge cases minimum
    - **Config-Only exception:** Flag-toggle features, no entity changes → authorization + edge cases minimum
- **Cross-cutting TC categories (when applicable):**
    - **Authorization TCs (MANDATORY):** Authorized succeeds, unauthorized rejected, role visibility verified
    - **Seed Data TCs:** Reference data exists, seeder runs correctly
    - **Performance TCs:** Feature within SLA under production-like volume
    - **Data Migration TCs:** Data transforms correctly, rollback works, no data loss
    - **Preservation TCs (MANDATORY bugfixes):** ≥1 per "Healthy input" row — authored from OLD code semantics BEFORE fix lands
- **Interactive review:** ALWAYS `AskUserQuestion` — review TC list with user before writing

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Mode Detection & Context

Detect mode from prompt and context:

| Mode                       | Signal                                            | Action                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TDD-first**              | PBI/story exists, code not yet written            | Generate specs from requirements                                  |
| **Implement-first**        | Code already exists, no/incomplete TCs            | Generate specs from codebase analysis                             |
| **Update**                 | Existing TCs + code changes / bugfix / PR         | Diff existing TCs against current code/PR, find gaps, update both |
| **Sync**                   | User says "sync test specs" or bidirectional need | Reconcile feature docs ↔ docs/specs/ (either direction)           |
| **From-integration-tests** | Tests exist with test spec annotations, no docs   | Extract TC metadata from test code → write to feature docs        |

### Mode Confirmation (AskUserQuestion)

**[REQUIRED]** Confirm mode before Phase 2 when signals ambiguous:

- Both "update" and "sync" present → which takes priority?
- No mode keyword → TDD-first (new feature) or implement-first (code exists)?
- "from integration tests" → high effort, confirm scope

> "Detected mode: **{detected_mode}** for feature: **{feature_name}**. TCs to write: ~{estimated_count}. Correct?"
>
> Options: [Yes, proceed] [Change mode] [Change scope]

Skip confirmation only when mode explicit in `$ARGUMENTS` AND feature name unambiguous.

**Must read FIRST:**

1. `docs/project-reference/feature-docs-reference.md` — correct `{FEATURE}` code for TC IDs (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)
2. Target feature doc — Section 15 exists? Read existing TCs to avoid ID collisions
3. `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` — Section 7 (TC Coverage Mapping), minimum categories and depth (read directly when relevant; do not rely on hook-injected conversation text)

**Spec Readiness Gate (BLOCKING — implement-first and update modes only):**

Read target feature doc Sections 5, 6, 8, 13. Check:

- Every BR-XX in Section 6 has `[Source: file:line]` citation — flag missing
- Every operation in Section 8 references ≥1 `BR-XX` — flag unreferenced operations
- Section 13 has permission matrix (≥1 role × action row) — flag if absent
- Section 4 has FR-XX entries with explicit outcomes — flag if empty/vague

If 2+ fail → `AskUserQuestion`: "Spec readiness below TC generation threshold. Fill gaps first OR proceed with shallow TCs (`Status: Planned`)?" NEVER silently generate shallow TCs.

**If target feature doc missing:** suggest `/feature-docs` first, OR create minimal Section 15 stub.

### Phase 2: Investigation

**TDD-first mode:**

1. Read PBI/story from `team-artifacts/pbis/` or user-provided
2. Extract acceptance criteria
3. Identify TC categories: CRUD, validation, **authorization** (mandatory), workflows, edge cases, seed data, performance data, data migration
4. Cross-reference existing feature doc requirements (Sections 1–14)
5. PBI Authorization section → generate authorization TCs (unauthorized rejection per role)
6. PBI Seed Data section → generate seed data TCs if reference/config data needed
7. PBI Data Migration section → generate migration TCs if schema changes exist

**Implement-first mode:**

**[BLOCKING]:** Enumerate ALL operations first — establishes minimum TC floor.

**Use Case Inventory (implement-first):**

```bash
# Write-side: CQRS command handlers
grep -r "ICommandHandler\|CommandHandler\b" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
# Write-side: REST mutating endpoints
grep -r "\[HttpPost\]\|\[HttpPut\]\|\[HttpPatch\]\|\[HttpDelete\]" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
# Event consumers / background jobs
grep -r "IConsumer\|EventHandler\|IMessageConsumer\|BackgroundJob\|IHostedService" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
# Read-side: CQRS query handlers
grep -r "IQueryHandler\|QueryHandler\b" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
# Read-side: REST GET endpoints
grep -r "\[HttpGet\]" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
```

Count: N (write) + M (read) + K (event/background) = **minimum TC count**.
If minimum > 20: split into operation-group batches (≤20 ops each per `TaskCreate`). NEVER generate all TCs in one pass for large features.

**Actor Catalog Discovery (MANDATORY — feeds authorization TCs):**

```bash
# Permission attributes and role guards
grep -r "\[Authorize\]\|RequirePermission\|IsInRole\|HasPermission" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -n | head -30
# Role/permission enums
grep -r "enum.*Role\|enum.*Permission" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -n | head -20
```

Build actor catalog: `[Role1, Role2,...]`. Authorization TC minimum = actor count × 2 (authorized succeeds + unauthorized rejected). Every actor MUST appear in ≥1 authorization TC.

1. Grep commands/queries: `grep -r "class.*Command.*:" src/Services/{service}/`
2. Grep entities and domain events
3. Trace: Controller → Command → Handler → Entity → Event Handler
4. Identify testable behaviors from implementation

**Update mode (post-change / post-bugfix / post-PR):**

**[BLOCKING]:** Run Use Case Inventory on full module BEFORE git diff. Check existing TC count in Section 15.

```bash
# Write-side
grep -r "ICommandHandler\|CommandHandler\b" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
grep -r "\[HttpPost\]\|\[HttpPut\]\|\[HttpPatch\]\|\[HttpDelete\]" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
grep -r "IConsumer\|EventHandler\|IMessageConsumer\|BackgroundJob\|IHostedService" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
# Read-side
grep -r "IQueryHandler\|QueryHandler\b" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
grep -r "\[HttpGet\]" src/Services/{service}/ --include="*.cs" -l
```

- Count N+M+K (Grand Total) = minimum TC count.
- Existing TC count < minimum → pre-existing coverage gap. Flag: `"Pre-existing gap: {existing}/{minimum} TCs"`. Generate gap-filling TCs in addition to update-triggered TCs.
- NEVER add TCs only for changed code when baseline already under-covered.

1. Read existing Section 15 TCs
2. `git diff` or `git diff main...HEAD` (for PRs) — find code changes since last TC update
3. Identify: new commands/queries not covered, changed behaviors, removed features
4. Bugfixes: add regression TC (e.g., `TC-ORD-040: Regression — order total calculation bypass`)
5. Generate gap analysis

> Before updating TCs to match the current code, determine: **Did the code drift from the spec, or was the spec wrong?**

If code still differs, the fix is incomplete.                                                                                                                                                                  |

>
> **Checkpoint:** Answer this question before proceeding: “Is the code change intentional and approved?” If yes, update TCs. If no (regression), the code needs fixing — do not update TCs to document broken behavior.

6. Update **both** feature docs Section 15 AND `docs/specs/` dashboard

#### Step UPDATE-FINAL: TC Blast Radius Analysis (UPDATE mode only)

> **[RECOMMENDED]** After updating TCs for the target feature, scan for other features whose TCs
> may be invalidated by the same code change.

**Run these greps against `docs/business-features/`:**

```bash
# 1. Find API endpoint references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{endpoint}" docs/business-features/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {endpoint} with the main API path changed (e.g., /api/employees, /api/invitations)

# 2. Find entity references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{entity-name}" docs/business-features/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {entity-name} with key domain entities changed (e.g., Employee, Invitation)

# 3. Find event references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{event-name}" docs/business-features/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {event-name} with events fired by the changed code
```

**Output:** List of potentially affected feature docs. For each hit:

1. Check if the referenced TC (Section 15) still describes valid behavior
2. If TC is stale → add to the UPDATE mode summary as "POTENTIALLY STALE: TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} in {other-module} — review recommended"
3. Do NOT auto-update those TCs — only the owner of that feature doc should update them

**Summary format for watzup/session end:**

```
TC Blast Radius Analysis:
- Changed: {current-feature} ({N} TCs updated)
- Potentially affected: {module-A} (references {entity/endpoint})
- Potentially affected: {module-B} (references {entity/endpoint})
- Action needed: Review TCs in affected modules before next release
```

**Skip when:**

- Change is UI-only (no API, entity, or event changes)
- Change is additive only (new endpoint added, no existing endpoint modified)
- Module has no dependency surface (standalone, no shared entities)

**Sync mode (bidirectional reconciliation):**

1. Read feature docs Section 15 TCs for target module
2. Read `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md` TCs
3. Read test files: grep for test spec annotations in `src/Services/{service}*.IntegrationTests/`
4. Build 3-way comparison table:

```
| TC ID | In Feature Doc? | In specs/? | In Test Code? | Action Needed |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| TC-FEAT-001 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| TC-FEAT-025 | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Add to specs/ |
| TC-FEAT-030 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Add to feature doc |
```

5. Reconcile: write missing TCs to whichever system lacks them
6. Feature docs remain source of truth — any conflict uses feature doc version

**From-integration-tests mode (reverse-engineer specs from existing tests):**

1. Grep `[Trait("TestSpec", "TC-...")]` in target test project
2. Per test method: extract TC ID, method name, test description from comments
3. Read test method body → generate GWT steps and evidence
4. Write extracted TCs to feature doc Section 15 (if not already there)
5. Useful when: tests written before spec system existed, or imported from another project

### TC Completeness Gate (BLOCKING — runs before Phase 3)

**[BLOCKING]** Do NOT start Phase 3 until all rows in this table show PASS:

| Gate                | Check                                 | Required                       | Actual | Status    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Write-op coverage   | TC count for CRUD/write ops           | ≥ N (write ops from inventory) | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Read-op coverage    | TC count for query/view ops           | ≥ M (read ops from inventory)  | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Event/job coverage  | TC count for events + background jobs | ≥ K (event/job count)          | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Permission coverage | TC count for authorization            | ≥ actor_count × 2              | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Total floor         | Total planned TCs                     | ≥ N + M + K (Grand Total)      | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |

**FAIL action:** TaskCreate for each FAIL row — list specific missing TC categories. NEVER proceed to Phase 3 until all gates PASS.

**Operation group decomposition:** If Grand Total > 20, split TC generation into batches of ≤20 related operations:

```
TaskCreate: "Generate CRUD TCs for {feature} — ops {1-N}: {CommandA}, {CommandB}, {CommandC}"
TaskCreate: "Generate Read TCs for {feature} — ops {1-M}: {QueryA}, {QueryB}"
TaskCreate: "Generate Event TCs for {feature} — ops {1-K}: {EventConsumerA}, {BackgroundJobA}"
TaskCreate: "Generate Permission TCs for {feature} — actors: {Role1}, {Role2}"
TaskCreate: "Generate Edge Case TCs for {feature} — boundary conditions from inventory"
```

Each batch task completes before starting the next. Final AskUserQuestion review covers all batches together.

### Phase 3: TC Generation with Interactive Review

1. Generate TC outlines as a summary table:

```
| TC ID | Name | Priority | Category | Status |
|-------|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-ORD-037 | Create order with multiple line items | P0 | CRUD | New |
| TC-ORD-038 | Reject order without required fields | P1 | Validation | New |
| TC-ORD-039 | Unauthenticated user cannot access orders | P0 | Permission | New |
```

2. Use `AskUserQuestion` to review with user:

```
Question: "These {N} test cases cover {feature}. Review the list:
[Coverage context: Use Case Inventory found {total_ops} total operations ({write_ops} write, {read_ops} read, {event_ops} event/background). {N} TCs planned = {coverage_pct}% operation coverage.]"
Options:
- "Approve as-is (Recommended)" — Proceed to writing
- "Add missing scenario" — Describe what's missing
- "Adjust priorities" — Change P0/P1/P2 assignments
- "Regenerate" — Re-analyze and try again
```

**Coverage context calculation:** `coverage_pct = (N / total_ops) × 100`. If `coverage_pct < 80%`: flag `⚠️ Coverage below 80% threshold` and suggest adding TCs before approving.

3. Iterate until user approves.

### Phase 4: Write to Feature Doc Section 15

**Canonical write — feature docs own TCs. NEVER overwrite existing TCs.**

1. Locate Section 15 in target feature doc
2. Section 15 exists: append new TCs after existing, preserve existing TC IDs
3. Section 15 absent: create from template
4. Use `Edit` tool to upsert

**TC format** (from `tdd-spec-template.md`):

```markdown
#### TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}: {Descriptive Test Name} [{Priority}]

**Objective:** {What this test verifies}

**Preconditions:**

- {Setup requirement}

**Test Steps:**
\`\`\`gherkin
Given {initial state}
And {additional context}
When {action}
Then {expected outcome}
And {additional verification}
\`\`\`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ {Success behavior}
- ❌ {Failure behavior}

**Test Data:**
\`\`\`json
{ "field": "value" }
\`\`\`

**Edge Cases:**

- {Boundary condition}

**Evidence:** `{FilePath}:{LineRange}` or `TBD (pre-implementation)`
```

**Evidence rules by mode:**

- **TDD-first:** `Evidence: TBD (pre-implementation)` — will be updated after implementation
- **Implement-first:** `Evidence: {actual file}:{actual lines}` — trace to real code
- **Update:** Update existing evidence references if code moved

### Phase 5: Update docs/specs/ Dashboard (Optional)

If `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md` exists:

1. Update Implementation Index with TC→test method mappings
2. TDD-first: map to expected test method names (created by `/integration-test`)
3. Update `PRIORITY-INDEX.md` with new TC entries in correct priority tier

**Skip** if user says "skip dashboard" or no `docs/specs/` file exists for module.

### Phase 6: Next Step Suggestion

Based on mode, suggest via `AskUserQuestion`:

**TDD-first:**

```
1. "/tdd-spec-review — Validate TC quality before generating tests (Recommended)"
2. "/integration-test — Generate test stubs from these TCs (skip review)"
3. "/plan — Plan the feature implementation"
4. "Done for now — I'll implement later"
```

**Implement-first:**

```
1. "/tdd-spec-review — Validate TC quality before generating tests (Recommended)"
2. "/integration-test — Generate integration tests (skip review)"
3. "/workflow-review-changes — Review all changes"
4. "Done for now"
```

**Update (post-change/PR):**

```
1. "/tdd-spec-review — Validate updated TCs before regenerating tests (Recommended)"
2. "/integration-test — Generate/update tests for changed TCs (skip review)"
3. "/test — Run existing tests to verify coverage"
4. "/tdd-spec [direction=sync] — Sync dashboard with updated TCs"
5. "Done for now"
```

**Sync:**

```
1. "/tdd-spec [direction=sync] — Sync dashboard after reconciliation (Recommended)"
2. "/integration-test — Generate tests for any TCs missing test coverage"
3. "Done for now"
```

**From-integration-tests:**

```
1. "/tdd-spec [direction=sync] — Sync dashboard with newly documented TCs (Recommended)"
2. "/test — Run tests to verify all documented TCs pass"
3. "Done for now"
```

## TC Decade-Based Numbering

**[BLOCKING] Before assigning any TC ID:** Read all existing TC IDs in the feature doc's Section 15. Find the next available decade slot.

| NNN Range | Category                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 001–009   | CRUD / Core operations (P0-P1)                                                                                                       |
| 011–019   | Validation / Business rules (P1-P2)                                                                                                  |
| 021–029   | Authorization / Permissions (P0-P1)                                                                                                  |
| 031–039   | Events / Background jobs (P1-P2)                                                                                                     |
| 041–049   | Cross-service / Integration (P1-P2) — See `SYNC:cross-service-check` above for full boundary scan checklist before writing these TCs |
| 051–059   | Edge cases / Error scenarios (P2-P3)                                                                                                 |
| 061–069   | UI / User journey flows (P2-P3)                                                                                                      |
| 071–099   | Reserved for feature-specific groups                                                                                                 |

**Collision prevention:**

1. Grep the feature doc for `TC-{FEAT}-` to list all existing IDs
2. Find the highest NNN in the target decade → assign next sequential
3. If a decade is full (9 entries), use the next available decade in the same category grouping
4. Never reuse a deprecated TC ID

## TC Deprecation Protocol

When feature behavior removed or significantly changed:

1. **NEVER delete TC** — preserve audit trail and git blame
2. Append `[DEPRECATED: {YYYY-MM-DD} — {reason}]` to title
3. Change `**Status:**` → `Deprecated`
4. Section 17 (Version History): `TC-{ID} deprecated — {reason}`
5. Test code: add `[Obsolete("TC deprecated: {reason}")]` attribute and skip test
6. Forward sync (`/tdd-spec [direction=sync]`) auto-handles deprecated TCs in QA dashboard

**Example:**

```
#### TC-USR-021: User Can View Profile [P1] [DEPRECATED: 2026-04-21 — Field removed per privacy policy]
**Status:** Deprecated
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Writing TCs to `docs/specs/` as the primary destination (use feature docs Section 15)
- ❌ Using `TC-{SVC}-{NNN}` or `TC-{SVC}-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format (use unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}`)
- ❌ Generating TCs without reading existing Section 15 (causes ID collisions)
- ❌ Skipping the interactive review step (user must approve TC list)
- ❌ Writing TCs without Evidence field (every TC needs it, even if `TBD`)

---

## See Also

- `tdd-spec-review` — TC quality review (use AFTER this skill to validate TC coverage and correctness)
- `tdd-spec [direction=sync]` — Native dashboard sync mode (aggregates TCs from feature docs to `docs/specs/` — replaces `test-specs-docs`)
- `integration-test` — Integration test code generator (use AFTER this skill to generate test stubs)
- `feature-docs` — Feature doc creator (creates the Section 15 that this skill populates)
- `refine` — PBI refinement (feeds acceptance criteria into this skill's TDD-first mode)

## Mode: Sync to Dashboard

**Triggered when:** "sync test specs", "update dashboard", "sync to feature docs", "reverse sync", "full sync", or `[direction=sync|forward|reverse|full]`.

> Engineering specs live at `docs/specs/{app-bucket}/{system-name}/`. This mode manages ONLY QA dashboard at `docs/specs/{Module}/`.
> **NEVER sync engineering specs here** — maintained by `workflow-spec-driven-dev`.

### Direction Detection

| Trigger phrase                                                                  | Direction | Behavior                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "sync test specs" / "update dashboard" / `direction=sync` / `direction=forward` | Forward   | Feature docs → `docs/specs/` dashboard  |
| "sync to feature docs" / "reverse sync" / `direction=reverse`                   | Reverse   | `docs/specs/` → feature docs Section 15 |
| "full sync" / "bidirectional" / `direction=full`                                | Full      | Both directions sequentially            |

**Default** (no direction specified): `forward`.

### Quality Gate (Before Any Sync)

**[BLOCKING]** Scan all TCs in module and flag:

- `Evidence = TBD` AND `Status = Tested` (contradiction)
- TCs missing GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structure
- TCs missing Acceptance Criteria

Produce quality report alongside sync output. **Do NOT block sync** — surface gaps and continue.

### Forward Sync Algorithm (Feature Docs → Dashboard)

1. Read all `TC-{FEAT}-{NNN}` entries from feature doc Section 15 (canonical source)
2. Read `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md` — extract existing TC IDs
3. Run quality gate — flag issues, log report
4. **Full-overwrite strategy:** Replace entire TC section in dashboard with re-extracted TCs from feature doc
    - NEVER merge — dashboard is derived, not canonical. Section 15 = single source of truth.

> **[REQUIRED] IntegrationTest field in dashboard rows:**
>
> When writing or updating TC rows in the QA dashboard, always populate the `IntegrationTest:` field
> with the traceability link format:
>
> ```
> IntegrationTest: {TestProject}::{TestClass}::{TestMethodName}
> ```
>
> If no integration test exists yet for this TC, write:
>
> ```
> IntegrationTest: (not yet implemented — run /integration-test [from-prompt] TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN})
> ```
>
> This creates a navigable link from the QA dashboard directly to the test code, and a TODO marker
> for TCs lacking test coverage. The "not yet implemented" text is detectable by tools scanning for
> coverage gaps.
>
> **Also add to dashboard header block:**
>
> ```markdown
> | Related Feature Doc | [docs/business-features/{Module}/README.md](../../business-features/{Module}/README.md) |
> | Engineering Spec | [docs/specs/{app-bucket}/{system-name}/](../{app-bucket}/{system-name}/) |
> ```

5. Update frontmatter in `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md`:
    ```yaml
    last_synced: YYYY-MM-DD
    last_synced_source: docs/business-features/{Module}/detailed-features/README.{FeatureName}.md
    tc_count: N
    ```
6. Run orphan check (see below)
7. Update `PRIORITY-INDEX.md` — add/update TCs in appropriate priority section
8. Ensure master `docs/specs/README.md` links to module

### Reverse Sync Algorithm (Dashboard → Feature Docs)

1. Read all TC IDs from `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md`
2. Read feature doc Section 15 — extract existing TC IDs
3. **ID-keyed merge:** TC in dashboard NOT in feature doc → insert into Section 15
    - NEVER overwrite existing TCs in feature doc (canonical)
    - Append new TCs at end of appropriate decade group
4. **[BLOCKING]** `AskUserQuestion` — present inserted TCs for user review before saving

### Orphaned TC Detection

TC orphaned when exists in `docs/specs/{Module}/README.md` but NOT in feature doc Section 15.

1. After forward sync: compute `orphans = dashboard_ids - feature_doc_ids`
2. Non-empty orphans:
    - Log: `⚠ Orphaned TCs detected: {count} TCs in dashboard have no canonical source`
    - List each orphaned TC-ID
    - Move to `### Quarantined TCs` subsection in dashboard (NEVER delete)
    - Add: `<!-- Orphaned {date}: no matching TC in feature docs Section 15 -->`
3. Orphaned TC has `[DEPRECATED]` in title → silently remove from dashboard

### Staleness Tracking

**Drift detection:** `git log --since={last_synced}` shows changes → flag stale before proceeding.

```bash
git log --since={last_synced} -- docs/business-features/{Module}/detailed-features/README.{FeatureName}.md
```

Non-empty output → warn: `⚠ Source feature doc changed since last sync on {last_synced}. Proceeding with forward sync.`

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **[BLOCKING]** NOT in a workflow? `AskUserQuestion` — do NOT decide complexity yourself. User decides:
>
> 1. **`pbi-to-tests` workflow** (Recommended) — tdd-spec → tdd-spec-review → quality-gate → workflow-end
> 2. **`/tdd-spec` directly** — standalone

## Next Steps

**[BLOCKING]** After completing, `AskUserQuestion` — do NOT skip:

- **"/tdd-spec-review (Recommended)"** — Validate TC quality (completeness, GWT format, coverage gaps)
- **"/integration-test"** — Generate integration test code directly (skip review when specs already reviewed)
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Standalone Chain

> **When called outside a workflow**, follow this chain. Each step is required unless marked [RECOMMENDED].

```
tdd-spec (you are here)
  │
  ├─ PREREQUISITE:
  │    [REQUIRED] feature-docs doc must exist at docs/business-features/{Module}/README.md
  │    If not found → run /feature-docs init first
  │
  ├─ CREATE mode (new feature):
  │    tdd-spec CREATE → /tdd-spec-review → /tdd-spec [direction=sync] → /integration-test [from-prompt]
  │
  ├─ UPDATE mode (code changed):
  │    *** Spec-Wrong? Gate first (see above) ***
  │    tdd-spec UPDATE → Step UPDATE-FINAL (Blast Radius) → /tdd-spec-review → /tdd-spec [direction=sync] → /integration-test [from-changes]
  │
  ├─ [REQUIRED] → /tdd-spec-review
  │     Always run after CREATE or UPDATE. Validates coverage and format.
  │
  ├─ [REQUIRED] → /tdd-spec [direction=sync]
  │     Always run after UPDATE to sync QA dashboard.
  │
  ├─ [REQUIRED] → /integration-test [from-changes or from-prompt]
  │     Generate/update integration test code for changed TCs.
  │
  └─ [RECOMMENDED] → /docs-update
        For full chain including feature-docs (Phase 2) and spec-discovery (Phase 2.5).
        Call when multiple doc layers may be stale.
```

### Integration with Bugfix Flow

When tdd-spec is called in **REGRESSION mode** (bugfix workflow):

1. Run **Spec-Wrong? Gate** FIRST (same logic as UPDATE mode)
2. If spec was wrong → run spec-discovery update BEFORE writing regression TCs
3. If code was wrong → write regression TC describing correct (expected) behavior, then proceed to fix
4. Regression TCs describe the CORRECT behavior, not the broken behavior

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**

```
# WRONG: Documenting the bug as expected behavior
TC-REG-001: GIVEN payment processed WHEN amount > limit THEN allow (← this was the bug)

# RIGHT: Documenting the fix as expected behavior
TC-REG-001: GIVEN payment processed WHEN amount > limit THEN reject with PaymentLimitExceededException
```

>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.

> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/README.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-docs-reference.md`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 3. Read every required doc that exists; skip absent docs as not applicable. Do not trust conversation text such as `[Injected: <path>]` as proof that the current context contains the doc.
> 4. Before target work, state: `Reference docs read: ... | Missing/not applicable: ...`.

UI cost usually dominates — bump SP one bucket if NEW UI surface (page/complex form/dashboard). Frontmatter MUST include `story_points`, `complexity`, `man_days_traditional`, `man_days_ai`, `estimate_scope_included`, `estimate_scope_excluded`, `estimate_reasoning` (UI vs backend cost driver).

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**[BLOCKING]** `TaskCreate` — break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.
**[BLOCKING]** `AskUserQuestion` — validate decisions with user. NEVER auto-decide.
**[REQUIRED]** Add final review todo task to verify work quality.
**[BLOCKING]** READ reference files before starting.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER write TCs to `docs/specs/` as primary destination — Section 15 is canonical.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER generate TCs without reading existing Section 15 — ID collisions corrupt registry.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run Spec-Wrong? Gate in UPDATE mode — NEVER update TCs to document broken behavior.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip interactive review (`AskUserQuestion`) — user must approve TC list before writing.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** authorization TCs are MANDATORY — every role must appear in ≥1 authorization TC.
