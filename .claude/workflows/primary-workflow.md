# Primary Workflow

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Define the standard development workflow phases and map them to the workflow catalog in `workflows.json`.

**Core Phases (all workflows follow subsets of these):**

1. **Discover** — Scout files, investigate patterns, run graph traces
2. **Plan** — `/plan` + `/plan-review` + `/plan-validate`, save in `./plans/`
3. **Design Review** — `/why-review` (rationale), `/tdd-spec` + `/tdd-spec-review` (test specs)
4. **Implement** — `/cook` or `/code`, compile-check after every file change
5. **Verify** — `/prove-fix`, `/test`, `/integration-test`, `/test-specs-docs`
6. **Quality** — `/workflow-review-changes` (consolidated: code-simplifier + review-changes + review-architecture + code-review + performance)
7. **Ship** — `/sre-review`, `/security`, `/changelog`, `/docs-update`, `/watzup`, `/workflow-end`

**Key Rules:**

- Understand code FIRST before any modification — mandatory, no exceptions
- Compile-check after every code change
- Never use fake data or mocks just to pass tests
- Activate relevant skills from catalog during the process
- Every claim needs `file:line` evidence, confidence >80% to act

---

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.

## Phase 0: Understand Code First (MANDATORY)

> **Understand-Code-First** — Do NOT write code, create plans, or attempt fixes until you READ existing code.
> Search 3+ similar implementations first. Run graph on key files (MANDATORY when graph.db exists).

- Read existing code before modifying. Validate assumptions with evidence. Search before creating.

## Phase 1: Planning

- Use `/plan` skill to create an implementation plan with tasks in `./plans/`
- Use `/research` skill for investigating technical topics before planning
- Validate plan via `/plan-review` (recursive until PASS) and `/plan-validate` (critical questions)
- **DO NOT** create new enhanced files — update existing files directly

## Phase 2: Design Review

- Use `/why-review` to validate design rationale before implementation
- Use `/tdd-spec` to write test specifications (feature doc Section 17) — CREATE mode before implementation, UPDATE mode after
- Use `/tdd-spec-review` to review test specs for coverage and correctness
- For features: two planning rounds — PLAN1 (architecture) then PLAN2 (incorporating test strategy)

## Phase 3: Implementation

- Use `/cook` or `/code` skill to implement the plan
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Follow established architectural patterns (CQRS, project store, BEM)
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- **[IMPORTANT]** After creating or modifying code, run compile command to check for errors

## Phase 4: Verification

- Use `/prove-fix` to build code proof traces (confidence scores, stack-trace-style evidence) — MANDATORY for bugfixes
- Use `/test` skill to run tests and analyze results
- Use `/integration-test` to generate integration tests from specs
- Use `/test-specs-docs` to sync test spec dashboard
- **IMPORTANT:** Never use fake data, mocks, cheats, or tricks just to pass the build
- **IMPORTANT:** Fix failing tests and re-run until all pass

## Phase 5: Quality

- Use `/workflow-review-changes` for consolidated review (code-simplifier + review-changes + review-architecture + code-review + performance), then plan + fix + re-review recursively until clean
- Alternatively use individual skills: `/code-simplifier`, `/code-review`, `/review-architecture`, `/performance`
- Follow coding standards and conventions
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

## Phase 6: Ship

- Use `/sre-review` for production readiness (service-layer/API changes)
- Use `/security` for security review
- Use `/changelog` to update changelog entries
- Use `/docs-update` to update documentation if needed
- Use `/watzup` for summary report of all changes
- Use `/workflow-end` to clear workflow state

## Phase 7: Debugging (when issues arise)

- Use `/debug` skill for systematic debugging when issues are reported
- Use `/fix` skill to apply fixes after root cause is identified
- Re-run tests after every fix to verify no regressions

## Workflow Catalog Reference

All workflows are defined in `.claude/workflows.json`. Each workflow composes a subset of the phases above into a specific sequence. Key workflows:

## Closing Reminders

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** understand existing code FIRST (read, grep 3+ patterns, graph trace) before ANY modification
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** compile-check after every code file change
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** never use fake data/mocks/cheats just to pass tests — fix real issues
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** activate relevant skills from catalog during the process
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect nearest matching workflow from catalog and ask user to confirm activation
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding investigation/plan/fix
