> **CRITICAL:** Do NOT use `EnterPlanMode` tool — it blocks Write/Edit/Task tools needed for plan creation. Follow the workflow below.
> **Planning is collaborative:** Validate plan, ask user to confirm, surface decision questions with recommendations.

## Your mission

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan Detection)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:

- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Active plan found: {path}. Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched plan hint only. Ask user if they want to activate it or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Proceed to create new plan using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow

- Analyze the given task and use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask for more details if needed.
- Decide to use `/plan:fast` or `/plan:hard` SlashCommands based on the complexity.
- Execute SlashCommand: `/plan:fast <detailed-instructions-prompt>` or `/plan:hard <detailed-instructions-prompt>`
- Activate `planning` skill.
- Note: `detailed-instructions-prompt` is **an enhanced prompt** that describes the task in detail based on the provided task description.

## MANDATORY: Plan Collaboration Protocol (READ THIS)

- **Do NOT use `EnterPlanMode` tool** — it blocks Write/Edit/Task tools needed to create plan files and launch subagents
- **Do NOT start implementing** — plan only, wait for user approval
- **ALWAYS validate:** After plan creation, execute `/plan:review` to validate the plan
- **ALWAYS confirm:** Ask user to review and approve the plan using `AskUserQuestion` with a recommendation
- **ALWAYS surface decisions:** Use `AskUserQuestion` with recommended options for key architectural/design decisions
- **Planning = Collaboration:** The plan is shaped by user input — never treat it as a unilateral output
- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end
- Sacrifice grammar for concision. List unresolved questions at the end
