Use `git-manager` agent to stage all files, create a meaningful commit based on the changes and push to remote repository.

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
