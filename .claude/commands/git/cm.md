Use `git-manager` agent to stage all files and create a commit.
**IMPORTANT: DO NOT push the changes to remote repository**

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
