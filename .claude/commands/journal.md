description: ⚡ Write some journal entries.
---

Use the `journal-writer` subagent to explore the memories and recent code changes, and write some journal entries.
Journal entries should be concise and focused on the most important events, key changes, impacts, and decisions.
Keep journal entries in the `./docs/journals/` directory.

## Task Planning Notes

- Always plan and break many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to review the works done at the end to find any fix or enhancement needed
