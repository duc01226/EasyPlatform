# Compact Context

Proactively compress the current conversation context to optimize token usage.

## When to Use

- Before starting a new task in a long session
- When working on multiple unrelated features
- At natural workflow checkpoints (after commits, PR creation)
- When context indicator shows high usage

## Actions

1. **Summarize completed work** - What was done, key decisions made
2. **Preserve essential context** - Active file paths, current task, blockers
3. **Clear redundant history** - Old exploration, superseded plans
4. **Update memory** - Save important patterns to `.claude/memory/`

## Best Practices

- Use `/compact` at natural breakpoints, not mid-task
- After compacting, briefly restate the current objective
- Check that critical file paths are still accessible
- If working on a bug, preserve error messages and stack traces

## Context Preservation Checklist

Before compacting, ensure you've saved:

- [ ] Current branch and uncommitted changes status
- [ ] Active file paths being modified
- [ ] Any error messages or stack traces
- [ ] Key decisions and their rationale
- [ ] Pending items from todo list

## Example Usage
