## Files Found

| File | Purpose | Has Evidence Rules |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `.claude/skills/feature-docs/SKILL.md` | Gold-standard feature docs | ✅ Updated |
| `.claude/skills/business-feature-docs/SKILL.md` | Business feature docs | ✅ Updated |
| `.claude/skills/test-specs-docs/SKILL.md` | Test specifications | ❌ Needs update |
| `.claude/agents/docs-manager.md` | Docs management agent | ❌ Needs update |
| `.claude/commands/docs/update.md` | Docs update command | ❌ Check needed |

## Current Evidence Requirements (Post-Update)

### feature-docs & business-feature-docs (UPDATED)
- Mandatory `Evidence: file:line` format
- 3-pass verification protocol
- Evidence sources table by test type
- Anti-hallucination checklist

## Gaps Remaining

1. **test-specs-docs/SKILL.md** - Needs evidence format section
2. **docs-manager.md agent** - Needs evidence verification instructions
3. **Commands** - May need consistency updates

## Recommended Remaining Changes

1. Add evidence section to test-specs-docs
2. Update docs-manager agent with verification protocol
3. Ensure commands reference updated skills
